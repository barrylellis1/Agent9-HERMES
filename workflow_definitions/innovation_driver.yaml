  name: Innovation Driver
  category: innovation
  description: >
    Enables highly skilled professionals to focus on business innovation by orchestrating probabilistic brainstorming, idea incubation,
    and opportunity shaping using LLMs and Agent9's full suite of analytical and planning agents. Estimates potential value, effort,
    and risk for new ideas, leveraging both LLM-enabled and expert-driven innovation. Calls on Opportunity Analysis, Risk Analysis,
    Stakeholder Analysis, Solution Finder, Implementation Planner, and optionally GenAI Expert or Solution Architect agents to shape,
    evaluate, and prepare innovations for execution.

    - implementation_plans: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    - genai_expert_feedback: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    - orchestrator_status: str

  validations:
    - All agent entrypoints must use Pydantic models as specified.
    - LLM-enabled and expert-driven opportunities must be tracked and auditable.
    - Innovation evaluations should include value, effort, and risk estimates.

  notes:
    - This workflow is intended to maximize the creative and strategic capacity of professionals by automating routine analysis and enabling structured innovation.
    - Can be iterated as new ideas are generated or as innovations move through incubation and review stages.
