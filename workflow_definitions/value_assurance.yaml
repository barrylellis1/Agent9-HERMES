      input_model: HITLNotificationInput
      output_model: None
      purpose: Escalate to executives if solution is implemented but value is not achieved as projected.

  outputs:
    - implementation_status: str
    - data_governance_status: str
    - qa_results: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    - stakeholder_adoption: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    - data_product_usage: Dict[str, Any]
    - kpi_comparison: Dict[str, Any]
    - lessons_learned: str
    - escalation_sent: bool

  validations:
    - All agent entrypoints must use Pydantic models as specified.
    - KPI actuals must be compared against projections for value tracking.
    - Stakeholder and principal adoption must be measured and auditable.
    - Lessons learned must be documented and available for process improvement.

  notes:
    - This workflow is triggered post-implementation and may iterate until value is confirmed or escalation is required.
    - Supports continuous improvement and organizational learning for Agent9 and stakeholders.
