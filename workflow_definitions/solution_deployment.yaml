    Orchestrates the deployment of a selected solution with Agent9 support for implementation planning, risk management,
  steps:
    - agent: A9_Orchestrator_Agent
      entrypoint: orchestrate_workflow
      input_model: OrchestratorWorkflowInput
      output_model: OrchestratorWorkflowOutput
      purpose: Oversee and coordinate the workflow execution, including step routing and monitoring.

    - agent: A9_LLM_Service_Agent
      entrypoint: process_text
      input_model: LLMServiceInput
      output_model: LLMServiceOutput
      optional: true
      purpose: Provide LLM-powered interpretation, summarization, or consensus-building for relevant TEXT fields.
    quality assurance, stakeholder engagement, change management, and iterative follow-up until the solution is fully implemented.

  steps:
    - agent: A9_Solution_Architect_Agent
      entrypoint: design_solution
      input_model: SolutionDesignInput
      output_model: SolutionDesignOutput
      purpose: Refine and finalize the implementation plan for the selected solution.

      entrypoint: manage_risk
      input_model: A9_Risk_Management_Input
      output_model: A9_Risk_Management_Output
      purpose: Assess, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with the solution deployment.

    - agent: A9_Quality_Assurance_Agent
      entrypoint: generate_test_cases
      input_model: QAPlanInput
      output_model: QAPlanOutput
      purpose: Develop and execute quality assurance plans to ensure solution reliability.

    - agent: A9_Stakeholder_Engagement_Agent
      entrypoint: analyze_stakeholder_engagement
      input_model: A9_Stakeholder_Engagement_Input
      output_model: A9_Stakeholder_Engagement_Output
      purpose: Engage and communicate with stakeholders to ensure alignment and support.

    - agent: A9_Change_Management_Agent
      entrypoint: process_change_request_event
      input_model: ChangeRequestEventInput
      output_model: ChangeRequestEventOutput
      purpose: Manage change requests and coordinate change management activities.

    - agent: A9_Orchestrator_Agent
      entrypoint: orchestrate_workflow
      input_model: OrchestratorWorkflowInput
      output_model: OrchestratorWorkflowOutput
      repeatable: true
      purpose: Oversee and coordinate the overall deployment process, including iterative follow-up and initiative tracking.

    - agent: A9_Quality_Assurance_Agent
      entrypoint: execute_tests
      input_model: QATestExecutionInput
      output_model: QATestExecutionOutput
      repeatable: true
      purpose: Repeatedly test and validate solution performance during and after deployment.

    - agent: A9_Stakeholder_Engagement_Agent
      entrypoint: get_audit_log
      input_model: None
      output_model: List[Dict[str, Any]]
      optional: true
      purpose: Review stakeholder engagement and feedback throughout the deployment.

  outputs:
    - deployment_status: str
    - risk_status: str
    - qa_results: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    - stakeholder_feedback: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    - change_management_log: List[Dict[str, Any]]

  validations:
    - All agent entrypoints must use Pydantic models as specified.
    - Orchestrator must track and coordinate all steps and follow-up actions.
    - Stakeholder engagement and QA results must be auditable and reviewable.

  notes:
    - This workflow repeats and iterates steps as needed until the solution is fully implemented and stabilized.
    - Further actions may include post-implementation review or transition to ongoing operations.
