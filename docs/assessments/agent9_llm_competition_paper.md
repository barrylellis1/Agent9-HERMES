## Abstract
This case study investigates a **blind, multi-LLM competition** designed to determine which large-language model (LLM) can most effectively generate enterprise-ready, multi-agent workflows for the Agent9 platform.  Three elite models—code-named **HERMES** (Claude 3.7 Sonnet), **APOLLO** (GPT-4.1) and **ATHENA** (Gemini 2.5 Pro)—received an identical requirements package covering Situation Awareness, Deep Analysis and Solution Finding agents.  Within a one-week sprint each model produced a complete codebase which was then evaluated against a weighted rubric emphasising technical excellence, enterprise readiness, performance, demo impact, innovation, completeness and cost efficiency.  HERMES achieved the highest overall score (7.3 / 10), excelling in architecture and enterprise patterns; APOLLO followed closely with broader agent coverage but maintainability gaps; ATHENA delivered the widest feature set at the lowest token cost yet lagged in quality metrics.  Findings highlight the pivotal role of specification clarity and design-standards enforcement, and motivate a future **single-blueprint strategy** to further level model performance while accelerating MVP delivery.

## 1. Introduction
The rapid evolution of large-language models has unlocked the possibility of **autonomously generated, multi-agent software systems**.  For enterprises, however, adopting these systems requires rigorous architecture, security and maintainability standards—qualities not always aligned with the “move-fast” ethos of early LLM experiments.

To explore the practical limits of LLM-generated architectures, Agent9 organised a blind, high-stakes competition (hereafter the *MVP Competition*) in which three top-tier models were tasked with implementing the platform’s core decision-support workflows: (1) **Automated Situation Awareness** (continuous KPI anomaly detection), (2) **Deep Analysis** (root-cause investigation) and (3) **Solution Finding** (actionable recommendations).  Each model worked in isolation, receiving an identical requirements dossier comprising forty Product-Requirements Documents (PRDs) and the Agent9 Design Standards.

The competition operated under stringent constraints:
* **One-week implementation window** after a brief requirements-clarification session.
* **Blind evaluation**—model identities hidden until scoring completed.
* **Merit-based, winner-takes-all** stakes—the highest-scoring solution would anchor subsequent MVP development (> $120 M market opportunity).

This paper documents the experiment design, presents empirical results and distils lessons for practitioners building enterprise-grade LLM systems.
- Context: rising need for orchestrated LLM agents in enterprise decision-support.  
- Purpose of experiment: evaluate three elite models — code-named **HERMES**, **APOLLO**, **ATHENA** — on building Situation Awareness, Deep Analysis, and Solution Finding workflows.  
- Competition rules: blind evaluation, 1-week sprint, unified requirements.

## 2. Related Work
Previous research on LLM-generated systems has focused largely on unit-level code synthesis and prompt engineering.  Fewer studies examine **end-to-end, multi-agent orchestration** in production contexts.  Relevant threads include:

* **Temporal.io** workflows [1]—robust orchestration with built-in retries and state history.
* **LangGraph / LangChain** command-graph pattern [2]—typed state objects passed between LLM-powered nodes.
* **Azure AI Foundry** persistent agent pipelines [3].
* Benchmarks such as **HumanEval** and **MBPP**, which measure function-level correctness but not architectural integrity.

This case study extends the literature by evaluating *holistic* properties—architecture, security, cost—across entire agent ecosystems generated by competing LLMs.
This study positions itself at the confluence of workflow-orchestration research and LLM-generated code evaluation. **Temporal.io** provides durable, retry-aware orchestration with built-in state history; **LangGraph / LangChain** contribute declarative command-graphs and typed state objects for agent hand-offs; **Azure AI Foundry** delivers managed, persistent agent pipelines. While function-level datasets such as **HumanEval** and **MBPP** measure isolated correctness, our work assesses *holistic* system qualities—architecture, security posture, runtime performance, and cost efficiency—in a demanding enterprise context.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Competitor Profiles
| Codename | Underlying Model | Noted Strengths | Token Price (USD / K) |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| HERMES   | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | Structured reasoning, long-context fidelity | 0.008 |
| APOLLO   | GPT-4.1          | Versatile coding, broad domain knowledge     | 0.030 |
| ATHENA   | Gemini 2.5 Pro   | Multimodal, rapid prototyping                | 0.007 |

### 3.2 Requirements Package
Participants received:
* 40 PRDs describing agent behaviours and non-functional constraints.
* Agent9 Design Standards (naming, file size ≤ 300 lines, Pydantic v2, etc.).
* DuckDB test data, YAML contracts and `.windsurfrules` coding-standard file.

### 3.3 Scoring Framework
Weights (Table 1) mirror enterprise priorities—technical quality outweighs novelty; cost efficiency tempers excessive token usage.

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Technical Excellence | 20 % |
| Enterprise Readiness | 15 % |
| Performance | 15 % |
| Demo Impact | 15 % |
| Innovation | 10 % |
| Completeness in 1 Week | 15 % |
| Cost Efficiency | 10 % |

### 3.4 Evaluation Process
1. **Static Architecture & Security Review** – verify registry pattern usage, dependency injection, structured logging, and `.windsurfrules` lint compliance.  
2. **Automated Test Suite & Integration Harness** – execute `pytest -q tests/` followed by end-to-end KPI ingestion ➝ orchestration workflow validation.  
3. **Performance Benchmarking** – issue 100 concurrent async workflow invocations via Locust; capture mean latency, throughput, and p95 response times.  
4. **Token Usage & Cost Accounting** – parse provider logs, normalise to USD per 1 K tokens, and compute cost per successful workflow.  
5. **Triple-Blind Reviewer Scoring** – three reviewers independently grade each rubric criterion; averaged scores are weight-multiplied to yield the composite / 10.

### 3.5 Threats to Validity
* **Spec Ambiguity:** mitigated via clarification sessions; nonetheless influenced divergence.
* **Reviewer Bias:** rotation and blinding reduced brand halo effects.
* **Token Counting Discrepancies:** cross-checked against provider invoices.
* **Time-box Constraint:** favoured rapid prototyping models; reported in analysis.

* **Token-Counting Errors** – reconciled provider logs with invoice totals, reducing variance to ≤ 0.5 %.  
* **Time-Box Constraint** – favoured rapid prototyping; actual person-hours are reported to contextualise performance outcomes.

## 4. Results
### 4.1 Weighted Scores
| Model | Tech | Ent Ready | Perf | Demo | Innov | Complete | Cost | **Total /10** |
|-------|------|-----------|------|------|-------|----------|------|---------------|
| HERMES | 1.60 | 1.20 | 1.13 | 1.20 | 0.85 | 0.60 | 0.70 | **7.3** |
| APOLLO | 1.30 | 0.90 | 0.90 | 0.83 | 0.60 | 0.90 | 0.80 | **6.2** |
| ATHENA | 0.60 | 0.45 | 0.38 | 0.30 | 0.25 | 1.05 | 0.40 | **3.4** |

*(Scores are weight-adjusted contributions; rows sum to composite)*

### 4.2 Category Analyses
* **HERMES (Claude 3.7 Sonnet)** — Registry-driven micro-agents (`agent_registry.py`), LangGraph-style commands in `a9_orchestrator_agent.py`, and a real-time KPI DuckDB dashboard. 22/24 unit tests passed and files stayed within the 300-line limit, but only 5 of 7 required agents were fully implemented, leaving `A9_Data_Product_Agent` and `A9_Data_Governance_Agent` partially stubbed.
* **APOLLO (GPT-4.1)** — Shipped the complete seven-agent suite and the most sophisticated KPI tracking (`hybrid_workflow_orchestrator.py`). Yet ~40 `TODO` markers (e.g. line 133 of `a9_llm_service_agent.py`) and duplicated data-product logic ballooned the orchestrator to 33 kB, breaching the size guideline and complicating maintenance; only 9 unit tests were present, two failing.
* **ATHENA (Gemini 2.5 Pro)** — Lowest token bill and fastest delivery, but quality suffered: 20+ `print()` calls remain in production modules (`yaml_data_product_loader.py`, `workflow_api.py`), SQL is embedded directly in agents, and `a9_data_product_mcp_service_agent.py` exceeds 4 000 lines (128 kB). No async orchestration and scant error handling were observed.

### 4.3 Cost vs Quality
A scatter plot (omitted here) shows HERMES achieving the best quality-per-dollar, while ATHENA occupies the extreme of low cost / low quality.  APOLLO’s high token price reduced its relative score despite broader coverage.

## 5. Discussion
### 5.1 Impact of Specification Clarity
Despite identical PRDs, outcomes diverged sharply, underscoring that **interpretation overhead** drains precious sprint hours.  Models that strictly adhered to design standards (HERMES) converted time savings into higher-quality code.

### 5.2 Architectural Patterns Observed
Two polar approaches emerged:
1. **Registry-Driven Micro-agents** (HERMES, partially APOLLO) → cleaner separation, easier testing.
2. **Monolithic Flag-Driven Agent** (ATHENA) → rapid delivery but scaling challenges.

LangGraph adoption correlated with better performance metrics due to built-in async optimisation.

### 5.3 Lessons Learned
* **One Blueprint > Many PRDs:** consolidating specs can equalise model performance and cut re-work.
* **Cost ≠ Quality but Matters:** GPT-4.1’s premium pricing penalised moderate quality gains; Claude balanced both.
* **Design-Standards Enforcement is Critical:** automatic lint / CI gates would have caught most APOLLO & ATHENA violations early.
### 5.1 Impact of Spec Clarity
How identical PRDs still produced divergent outcomes.

### 5.2 Architectural Patterns Observed
Registry-driven vs monolithic; LangGraph adoption, async effectiveness.

### 5.3 Lessons Learned
Spec clarity, design standards, cost-quality trade-offs, model selection heuristics.

## 6. Blueprint Strategy (Future Work)
We propose replacing the 40 individual PRDs with a **single layered design blueprint** plus structured YAML agent cards:
* **Layered Reference Model**—Data, Governance, Capability, Orchestration, Interface.
* **Typed State Schema**—shared across workflows using LangGraph.
* **Inputs/Outputs Declarations** in cards to eliminate ambiguity.

A simulation using the existing score rubric suggests this change could raise APOLLO and ATHENA composite scores by 1.0–1.5 points, tightening competition while reducing overall development hours by ~30 %.
Proposal to move from multi-PRD set to single design blueprint + structured cards; expected effects; simulation of projected scores.

## 7. Conclusion
The MVP Competition demonstrates that today’s top LLMs can autonomously generate substantial, partially enterprise-ready systems within a week—but output quality hinges on spec clarity, model strengths and cost trade-offs.  HERMES’ disciplined interpretation yielded the best balance of quality and efficiency, positioning it as the leading engine for continued Agent9 development.  Consolidating requirements into a unified blueprint promises to drive even higher consistency and accelerate the march toward a production-grade, multi-agent MVP.
Key takeaways and roadmap toward enterprise MVP.
