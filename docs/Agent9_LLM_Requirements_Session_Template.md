# Agent9 LLM Requirements Clarification Session Template

## Session Overview

**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Participants:** [LLM Name] (OpenAI/Gemini/Claude Sonnet)  
**Objective:** Clarify requirements for Agent9 core workflows and identify gaps/recommendations

## Introduction (5 minutes)

### Project Context
Agent9 is an agent-based orchestration system designed to provide automated business insights and solutions through a series of specialized agents working together. The system focuses on three core workflows:

1. **Automated Situation Awareness** - Identifies business situations requiring attention
2. **Deep Analysis** - Performs detailed analysis of identified situations
3. **Solution Finding** - Generates and evaluates potential solutions

### MVP Development Objective
We're conducting an LLM hackathon to determine which LLM can most effectively implement these core workflows with the fewest errors and best performance. Your input during this requirements clarification session will help create a unified requirements document for the implementation phase.

## Requirements Deep Dive (15 minutes)

### Core Workflow 1: Automated Situation Awareness

**Key Questions:**
1. Based on the PRDs and design documents, what are the essential components of the Situation Awareness workflow?
2. What are the primary inputs and outputs for this workflow?
3. How should this workflow integrate with the Principal Context Agent?
4. What data sources and models are required for this workflow?
5. What potential implementation challenges do you foresee?

### Core Workflow 2: Deep Analysis

**Key Questions:**
1. What are the key analysis techniques required for this workflow?
2. How should the analysis results be structured for downstream consumption?
3. What integration points exist between Deep Analysis and other agents?
4. What data models and transformations are needed?
5. What are the performance considerations for this workflow?

### Core Workflow 3: Solution Finding

**Key Questions:**
1. What methods should be used to generate potential solutions?
2. How should solutions be evaluated and ranked?
3. What integration points exist with other agents and workflows?
4. What are the key data structures for solution representation?
5. How should human feedback be incorporated into the solution process?

## Registry Requirements (5 minutes)

### Agent Registry
1. What are the essential capabilities needed for agent registration and lifecycle management?
2. How should agent configuration validation be handled?
3. What event logging requirements exist?

### KPI Registry
1. How should KPIs be structured and associated with business processes?
2. What threshold management capabilities are needed?
3. How should KPIs integrate with principal profiles?

### Principal Profiles Registry
1. What profile attributes are essential for decision-making contexts?
2. How should role-based access control be implemented?
3. What extensibility requirements exist for future HR integration?

### Data Product Registry
1. How should data products be defined and validated?
2. What mapping capabilities are needed between KPIs and data products?
3. What contract validation requirements exist?

## Gap Analysis (5 minutes)

1. What potential gaps or ambiguities do you see in the current requirements?
2. Are there any missing dependencies or components?
3. What edge cases should be considered in the implementation?
4. Are there any potential conflicts between components or workflows?
5. What testing considerations should be addressed?

## Recommendations (5 minutes)

1. What implementation approach would you recommend for these workflows?
2. Are there any architectural patterns that would be particularly well-suited?
3. What potential optimizations could improve performance or maintainability?
4. How would you recommend structuring the codebase for these workflows?
5. What testing strategies would be most effective?

## Conclusion

Thank you for your insights and recommendations. Your input will be combined with feedback from other LLMs to create a unified requirements document for the implementation phase of the hackathon.
