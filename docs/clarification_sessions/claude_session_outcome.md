# Agent9 LLM Requirements Clarification Session Outcome

## Session Information

**LLM:** Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking)  
**Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Session ID:** Claude-2025-07-15

## Executive Summary

The requirements clarification session identified critical workflow handoff requirements, architectural patterns for context persistence, and integration approaches for Agent9's core workflows. Key findings include the need for proper context handoff between Automated Situation Awareness, Deep Analysis, and Solution Finding workflows to avoid redundant re-execution of logic. The session clarified HITL integration patterns, orchestration responsibilities, and UI requirements using Material Admin Pro. The MVP should focus on end-to-end testing with provided SAP Datasphere test data, implementing workflow registries, and ensuring proper error handling with partial result capture.

## Registry Requirements Analysis

### Agent Registry
- Currently empty directories with no implementation
- Needs to support agent discovery and registration
- Should track agent capabilities and availability
- Registry to be workflow-driven and centralized in orchestrator
- Should prioritize safety and reliability in implementation

### KPI Registry
- Contains approximately 20 KPIs for monitoring
- Must support thresholds and trending information
- Should provide KPI metadata for LLM consumption
- Used by Situation Awareness to identify anomalies
- Requires metadata on ownership, criticality, and variance thresholds

### Principal Profiles Registry
- Contains profiles like CEO, CFO, COO, CIO, etc.
- Used for test scenarios and persona-based testing
- Should include responsibilities, data ownership, and business process ownership
- Future refinement of workflow triggers based on principal context

### Data Product Registry
- Currently empty directory with no implementation
- Should track available data products and their schemas
- Required for accessing SAP Datasphere test data
- Must integrate with YAML data contracts

## Gap Analysis

### Identified Gaps
- **Workflow Handoff**: Current workflow definitions incorrectly re-execute previous workflow logic; need proper context handoff
- **Registry Implementation**: Empty registry directories with no implementation code
- **Orchestration Security**: No authentication design between Orchestrator and agents
- **Error Classification**: Need structured approach to error handling with partial result capture
- **HITL Framework**: Missing notification templates and response processing framework

## Recommendations

### Architecture Recommendations
- Implement a hybrid context persistence approach with in-memory storage during execution and registry updates at transition points
- Design a modular registry architecture with separate registries for each domain and a common base interface
- Centralize orchestration control with YAML-based workflow definitions
- Support conditional branching and dynamic workflow modification
- Use JSON with Pydantic for serialization, including verbose text fields for LLM consumption

### Implementation Approach
- Prioritize workflow handoff correction as a critical first step
- Implement progressive workflow context objects that evolve through each stage
- Build error-tolerant workflow execution with partial result capture
- Create HITL notification framework with Gmail integration
- Use Material Admin Pro for UI components in next phase

### Code Structure
- Maintain clear separation between workflow logic, registry operations, and orchestration
- Follow Agent9 naming conventions and architectural standards
- Develop registry interfaces before implementations to ensure consistency
- Create dedicated HITL service for notification management
- Centralize error logging in the orchestrator

### Testing Strategy
- Use end-to-end testing of complete workflows
- Leverage SAP Datasphere test data for Finance, Sales, and HR
- Configure test scenarios for each principal profile (CEO, CFO, etc.)
- Test workflow transitions with context validation
- Verify proper error handling with partial results

### Performance Optimizations
- Focus on memory efficiency due to 8GB RAM constraint
- Optimize database operations for ~40MB test data volume
- Consider LLM prompt optimization to reduce token usage
- Implement asynchronous processing for background operations
- Track external API usage during hackathon

## Unique Insights
- Workflow handoff is the critical architectural improvement needed; current designs incorrectly re-execute previous workflow steps
- Hybrid serialization approach combining structured JSON with verbose narrative fields will optimize for both machine and LLM consumption
- Principal Context can refine workflow triggering based on responsibilities, data ownership, and business process ownership
- HITL interactions should follow three patterns: branch selection, verification requests, and chat initiation
- Semi-autonomous background execution model supports the expected pace of one new situation per user per week

## Questions for Clarification
- What is the expected behavior when a required agent is unavailable?
- Are there specific authentication mechanisms preferred for agent-orchestrator communication?
- What specific HITL email templates and formats should be used?
- Are there any compliance or regulatory requirements for audit logging?
- Should solution evaluations include specific ROI calculation methodologies?

## Appendix

### Orchestration Control Requirements
- Orchestrator solely responsible for workflow transitions, error recovery, and tracking workflow state
- Workflow steps defined in YAML with desired support for conditional branching and dynamic modification
- Agent registration should prioritize safety and reliability (implementation approach to be determined)
- Orchestrator should provide in-progress workflow monitoring in Decision Studio
- Error handling should be centralized with partial result capture
- Centralized audit logging required for orchestration activities

### Technical Constraints Summary
- 8GB RAM limitation
- ~40MB test data in CSV files
- Daily Situation Awareness execution
- Approximately 20 KPIs to monitor
- Expected one new situation per user per week
