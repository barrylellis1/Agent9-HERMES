# KPI Mapping Delegation Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the Situation Awareness Agent to delegate KPI mapping responsibilities to the Data Governance Agent, in alignment with the Agent9 architecture principles of strict separation of concerns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Situation Awareness Agent Updates

#### Connection to Data Governance Agent
- Updated the `connect()` method to obtain a reference to the Data Governance Agent via the orchestrator
- Added proper error handling for cases where the Data Governance Agent is unavailable

#### KPI Mapping Delegation
- Modified the `process_nl_query()` method to use the Data Governance Agent's `map_kpis_to_data_products` method
- Added proper error handling with fallback to legacy methods during the transition period

#### View Name Resolution
- Updated the `_get_kpi_value()` method to use the Data Governance Agent's `get_view_name_for_kpi` method
- Added fallback logic to use local resolution if the Data Governance Agent is unavailable or returns an error

#### Deprecated Methods
- Marked internal methods for KPI registry loading and filtering as deprecated with warnings
- Left these methods in place for backward compatibility during the transition period

### 2. Testing

#### Unit Tests
- Created unit tests to verify that the Situation Awareness Agent correctly delegates KPI mapping to the Data Governance Agent
- Added tests for view name resolution via the Data Governance Agent

#### Manual Testing
- Created a manual test script to verify the KPI view name resolution delegation
- Verified that the Situation Awareness Agent attempts to connect to the Data Governance Agent

## Benefits

1. **Architectural Alignment**: The refactoring ensures that the Situation Awareness Agent follows the Agent9 architecture principles of strict separation of concerns.

2. **Single Source of Truth**: The Data Governance Agent is now the single source of truth for KPI to data product mappings, improving maintainability and scalability.

3. **Reduced Duplication**: Removed duplicate KPI mapping logic from the Situation Awareness Agent.

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Added robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure graceful degradation if the Data Governance Agent is unavailable.

## Next Steps

1. **Remove Deprecated Methods**: Once the full migration is complete, remove the deprecated methods from the Situation Awareness Agent.

2. **Update Documentation**: Update the Agent9 architecture documentation to reflect the new delegation pattern.

3. **Integration Testing**: Perform comprehensive integration testing across agents to ensure the KPI mapping delegation works as expected in all scenarios.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the KPI mapping delegation to minimize latency and improve performance.
