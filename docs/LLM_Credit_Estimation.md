# Agent9 LLM MVP Development Credit Estimation

This document provides an estimate of the LLM credits required for the complete Agent9 LLM MVP Development experiment across all phases and models.

## Credit Estimation Methodology

The estimation is based on:
- Average token usage for similar software development projects
- Complexity of the Agent9 architecture and requirements
- Multiple phases of the experiment
- Multiple models being tested

## Phase 1: Requirements Clarification Sessions

Each requirements clarification session involves reviewing extensive documentation, analyzing requirements, and providing recommendations.

| Model | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Total Tokens | Approx. Cost (USD) |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| GPT-4 | 25,000 | 15,000 | 40,000 | $0.80 |
| Gemini Pro | 25,000 | 15,000 | 40,000 | $0.50 |
| Claude | 25,000 | 15,000 | 40,000 | $0.60 |

**Phase 1 Subtotal (3 models):** ~120,000 tokens, ~$1.90 USD

## Phase 2: Implementation

Implementation involves code generation for multiple agents, UI components, and integration logic. This is the most credit-intensive phase.

### Per Model Implementation Estimate

| Component | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Sessions | Total Tokens |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| Situation Awareness Agent | 30,000 | 40,000 | 3 | 210,000 |
| Deep Analysis Agent | 25,000 | 35,000 | 3 | 180,000 |
| Solution Finding Agent | 25,000 | 35,000 | 3 | 180,000 |
| UI Implementation | 20,000 | 30,000 | 2 | 100,000 |
| Integration & Testing | 30,000 | 20,000 | 3 | 150,000 |

**Per Model Implementation:** ~820,000 tokens

| Model | Total Tokens | Approx. Cost (USD) |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| GPT-4 | 820,000 | $16.40 |
| Gemini Pro | 820,000 | $10.25 |
| Claude | 820,000 | $12.30 |

**Phase 2 Subtotal (3 models):** ~2,460,000 tokens, ~$38.95 USD

## Phase 3: Evaluation

The evaluation phase involves an independent LLM reviewing and comparing all implementations.

| Activity | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Total Tokens | Approx. Cost (USD) |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Code Review | 300,000 | 50,000 | 350,000 | $7.00 |
| Comparative Analysis | 100,000 | 30,000 | 130,000 | $2.60 |
| Final Report | 50,000 | 20,000 | 70,000 | $1.40 |

**Phase 3 Subtotal:** ~550,000 tokens, ~$11.00 USD

## Total Estimated Credits

| Phase | Total Tokens | Approx. Cost (USD) |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Phase 1: Requirements | 120,000 | $1.90 |
| Phase 2: Implementation | 2,460,000 | $38.95 |
| Phase 3: Evaluation | 550,000 | $11.00 |
| **Grand Total** | **3,130,000** | **$51.85** |

## Contingency Planning

It's recommended to budget for a 30% contingency to account for:
- Additional iterations or revisions
- Debugging sessions
- Expanded requirements
- Additional testing scenarios

**With 30% Contingency:** ~4,069,000 tokens, ~$67.40 USD

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Focused Requirements Sessions**: Carefully scope the requirements sessions to focus on critical aspects
2. **Chunked Implementation**: Break implementation into smaller, focused chunks
3. **Reuse Generated Code**: Where possible, reuse code generated in earlier sessions
4. **Prioritize Components**: Focus on core components first, add nice-to-have features only if budget allows
5. **Optimize Prompts**: Craft efficient prompts that reduce token usage while maintaining quality

## Tracking Actual Usage

During the experiment, track actual token usage for each session and compare against these estimates. This will help:
1. Manage the overall budget
2. Identify which models are most efficient
3. Refine future estimations
4. Provide data for the cost-efficiency evaluation metric

## Notes

- Actual costs may vary based on model pricing at the time of the experiment
- Token counts are estimates and may vary based on actual implementation complexity
- Different models have different pricing structures; this estimate uses approximate averages
- The evaluation assumes using GPT-4 as the independent evaluator
