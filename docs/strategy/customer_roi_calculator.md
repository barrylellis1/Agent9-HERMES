# Agent9 Customer ROI Calculator

## ⚠️ Validation Disclaimer

**Status:** Pre-revenue, unvalidated assumptions

This ROI calculator is based on:
- **Projected pricing** (not validated with paying customers)
- **Estimated savings** (not verified through actual deployments)
- **Assumed adoption rates** (no real-world data)

**Use with caution:** These projections represent best-case scenarios and should not be used for financial planning until Agent9 has 3+ paying customers with documented ROI.

**Last Updated:** February 13, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This calculator covers **three independent ROI scenarios** reflecting Agent9's three value pillars. Customers will typically lead with one pillar and expand to others over time.

- **Scenario A:** FP&A team time savings (fastest ROI, primary entry point)
- **Scenario B:** Consulting spend reduction (mid-market enterprise)
- **Scenario C:** Large enterprise full deployment

Each scenario stands alone — a customer does not need to use all three to achieve positive ROI.

## ROI Model

### Scenario A: FP&A Team Time Savings *(Primary Entry Point — Fastest ROI)*

**Current State (Manual FP&A Monthly Process)**
| Activity | Hours/Month | Fully-Loaded Cost (@ $120K/year analyst) |
|----------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| Data gathering and variance extraction | 20 hrs | $1,200 |
| Writing executive narratives (3 versions per exec) | 30 hrs | $1,800 |
| Anomaly investigation and root cause | 15 hrs | $900 |
| Board pack preparation | 20 hrs | $1,200 |
| Ad-hoc CFO questions | 15 hrs | $900 |
| **Total monthly FP&A cost (2 analysts)** | **200 hrs** | **$12,000** |

**With Agent9 (Continuous Monitoring + Automated Narrative)**
| Activity | Hours/Month | Cost |
|----------|------------|------|
| Review Agent9 situation cards + approve narratives | 20 hrs | $1,200 |
| Strategic analysis and forward-looking work | 80 hrs | $4,800 |
| Agent9 platform subscription | — | $5,000/month |
| **Total monthly cost** | **100 hrs** | **$11,000** |

**ROI Summary — FP&A Scenario**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Monthly analyst time freed | 100 hours (50% reduction) |
| Annual analyst cost savings | $72,000 |
| Agent9 annual cost | $60,000 |
| **Year 1 Net Savings** | **$12,000** |
| **Year 2+ Net Savings** | **$72,000** (no onboarding cost) |
| Payback Period | 10 months |
| Strategic value (analysts redirected to forward-looking work) | Unquantified but significant |

*Note: This ROI scenario is independent of consulting spend. A company spending $0 on consulting still achieves positive ROI through analyst productivity gains.*
