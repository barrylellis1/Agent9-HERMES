# Agent9: AI-Powered Decision Intelligence

## One-Page Executive Summary
**Last Updated:** February 13, 2026

---

### The Problem

Enterprise decision-makers spend **$800B+ annually** on consulting, yet:
- Insights arrive **weeks or months** after problems emerge
- Recommendations come from **one firm's perspective**
- **No audit trail** for how conclusions were reached
- **IP is trapped** in slide decks and consultants' heads
- **Scaling requires linear headcount** growth

---

### The Solution

**Agent9** is an **AI-powered decision intelligence platform** for mid-market CFOs — combining registry-driven domain context, continuous KPI monitoring, and multi-agent analysis to surface the right insight for the right executive, automatically and continuously.

*Note: Branded consulting firm agents (McKinsey, BCG, etc.) are a Year 3+ marketplace feature. The platform today delivers consulting-methodology-quality analysis through encoded frameworks (SCQA, KT Is/Is-Not, multi-lens trade-off analysis) — not through external firm partnerships.*
