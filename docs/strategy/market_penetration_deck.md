# SLIDE 2: The Problem

## Enterprise Decision-Making Has Three Unsolved Problems

**Problem 1 — You're always reacting, never anticipating**
- KPI review happens weekly, monthly, or when someone notices something wrong
- By the time you commission analysis, the problem is already expensive
- No system continuously watches your business for you

**Problem 2 — Consulting is slow, expensive, and point-in-time**
| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Consulting is slow** | 12-24 weeks for strategic insights |
| **Consulting is expensive** | $500K-$2M minimum engagements |
| **One perspective** | Single firm's bias, no debate |
| **No audit trail** | "Trust us" doesn't satisfy boards |
| **Engagement ends** | Problem fixed, monitoring stops |

**Problem 3 — Institutional knowledge is fragile**
- KPI definitions live in analysts' heads and Excel files
- Decision rationale is buried in email threads and slide decks
- When the Finance Director leaves, the knowledge leaves too

> **"By the time we get the analysis, the market has moved."** — Fortune 500 CFO
> **"We rebuilt our entire margin model when the CFO changed."** — PE portfolio ops lead

# SLIDE 8: Market Segmentation

## Who We're Targeting — and in What Order

| Segment | Size | ARPU | Priority | Entry Rationale |
|---------|------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **VP FP&A / Finance Planning** | 10,000+ | $30K-$60K | ⭐⭐⭐ | Fastest sales cycle; acute pain; creates CFO champion |
| **Mid-Market CFOs** | 10,000+ | $60K-$120K | ⭐⭐⭐ | Primary expansion buyer; multi-pillar value |
| **PE Portfolio Ops** | 500 firms | $150K-$230K | ⭐⭐⭐ | Cross-portfolio deployment; LP reporting value |
| **Corp Strategy Teams** | 500 F500 | $150K-$300K | ⭐⭐ (Year 2+) | Longer procurement; needs reference customers first |

### The Sales Motion: FP&A Entry → CFO Expansion → PE Portfolio

1. **Enter via FP&A pain** — Monthly close automation, narrative generation, anomaly detection
2. **Demonstrate value in first monthly cycle** — CFO sees the output, becomes champion
3. **Expand to CFO use cases** — Solution Finder, audit trail, board pack preparation
4. **PE portfolio** — One portfolio company pilot → cross-portfolio deployment

### Why These Segments?
- **Data-mature** — Already have clean, accessible ERP and BI infrastructure
- **Consulting fatigue** — Frustrated with cost/speed of traditional model
- **FP&A capacity constraint** — Under-resourced teams need leverage, not more headcount
- **Compliance pressure** — Value audit trail for board, investors, and regulators

---

# SLIDE 9: Ideal Customer Profile

## The Perfect Early Adopter

### Must-Haves
- ✅ Existing data infrastructure (ERP, BI, data warehouse)
- ✅ Analytics team that can validate outputs
- ✅ Executive sponsor with innovation budget
- ✅ $1M+ annual consulting spend (pain is real)

### Trigger Events
- 🎯 New CFO/CSO hire (first 90 days)
- 🎯 PE acquisition (value creation mandate)
- 🎯 Activist investor pressure
- 🎯 IPO preparation
- 🎯 Cost reduction initiative

### Anti-Patterns (Avoid)
- ❌ No data infrastructure
- ❌ "Innovation theater" culture

# SLIDE 11: Partner Strategy

## Why Partners Will Join

### The Revenue Erosion Reframe

| Fear | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "We'll cannibalize our revenue" | Access markets you can't serve today |
| "Our IP will be commoditized" | Monetize IP that's currently free |
| "Clients won't need us" | Agents generate leads for human work |

### Partner Economics

| Metric | Traditional | With Agent9 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Clients served/year | 50-100 | 5,000+ |
| Revenue per client | $500K-$2M | $5K-$50K (entry) + upsell |
| IP monetization | $0 | $500K+/year passive |
| **Total Revenue** | $100M | **$120M+ (+20%)** |

---

# SLIDE 12: Partner Tiers

## Structured Partnership Program

| Tier | Profile | Investment | Benefits |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Strategic** | Top 10 firms, cloud vendors | $37.5K + methodology | 75% subsidy, exclusivity, co-marketing |
| **Innovation** | Mid-tier, boutiques, ISVs | $150K | Standard pricing, marketplace listing |
| **Ecosystem** | Independents, experts | Self-serve | Revenue share, community support |

### Pilot Program: 14 Weeks
1. **Discovery (2 wks)** — Map methodology to agent capabilities
2. **Build (6 wks)** — Develop branded agent with partner IP
3. **Validate (6 wks)** — Pilot with 3-5 mutual customers

# SLIDE 13: Competitive Landscape

## We're Creating a New Category

| Player | What They Do | Gap |

| **Runway/Numeric** | AI FP&A | Narrow financial ops only |
| **AWS/Azure Agents** | Cloud orchestration | No domain model or methodology |
| **ChatGPT/Claude** | Generic AI | No registry context or audit trail |

# SLIDE 14: Defensibility

## Our Moat Deepens Over Time

| Moat | Durability | How It Works |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Registry-Driven Domain Intelligence** | 🟢 Strong | KPI definitions, principal profiles, business process mappings — deep enterprise context no generic platform provides |
| **Decision Outcome Corpus** | 🟢 Strong | Every debate builds proprietary dataset of decision patterns |
| **Audit Trail Standard** | 🟡 Medium | First to define "explainable AI decision intelligence" |
| **Switching Costs** | 🟡 Medium | Data product onboarding, registry config, workflow integration |
| **Partner Network** | 🔴 Future | Not a moat until partners exist (Year 3+) |

### Flywheel Effect (Updated)
```
Registry depth → Better analysis → Customer value →
More customers → More decision data →
Better recommendations → Higher retention →
Partner interest (Year 3+)

---

# SLIDE 18: The Ask

## What We Need to Execute

### For Early Customers
- **Seeking:** 1-2 pilot customers by Sep 2026
- **Pricing:** $15K-$25K for 3-6 month pilot
- **Timeline:** 8-12 weeks to first insights
- **Outcome:** Validated decision intelligence capability, case study

### For Future Investors (Post-Revenue)
- **Timing:** After 3+ paying customers, $200K+ ARR
- **Use Case:** Scale sales, expand product, hire team
- **Not seeking funding now:** Bootstrapping to first revenue

---

# SLIDE 19: Why Now?

## The Window is Open — and Closing

### Technology Reality Check
- Multi-agent orchestration is commodity infrastructure by Q4 2027 (AWS/Azure/GCP GA)
- **Agent9's moat:** Registry-driven domain intelligence + 5-day onboarding templates + decision corpus — NOT orchestration
- LLMs capable enough for enterprise decision support today; cost dropping 90%+ improves margins

### Market Timing
- **18-24 month window** before consulting firms expand AI downmarket (McKinsey Lilli, BCG X moving fast)
- Mid-market CFOs and FP&A teams actively looking for leverage — AI tool budgets are live
- Regulatory push for AI explainability directly favors audit trail approach
- **First paying customer by Sep 2026 is not optional** — it is the single most critical milestone

### The Four Moats Being Built Now
1. **Template library** — SAP onboarding templates accumulate with every customer
2. **Decision corpus** — Every analysis improves recommendations; needs customers to grow
3. **Operational embedding** — Monthly close process integration grows switching cost monthly
4. **Consulting partner pipeline** — Cultivate mid-tier firm relationships now; activate Year 3

### Competitive Urgency
- AI finance startups well-funded (Hebbia $130M, Runway $60M+) but narrow scope (documents, FP&A)
- None have continuous monitoring + multi-perspective debate + audit trail + domain registry in one platform
- Window to establish as the "decision intelligence" category is 12-18 months

# SLIDE 20: Summary

## Agent9: AI-Powered Decision Intelligence

| What | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **Registry-driven context** | Deep domain intelligence, not generic AI |
| **Multi-agent debate** | Multiple perspectives, auditable decisions |
| **CFO-focused MVP** | Narrow, deep vs broad, shallow |
| **Application first** | Prove value before building marketplace |
| **Solo founder, moonlighting** | Capital-efficient path to first revenue |

### The Opportunity
Build decision intelligence for mid-market CFOs that consulting firms ignore and AI startups can't match on domain depth.

### Next Steps
- Demo video: Apr 2026
- First pilot signed: Sep 2026
- 5 customers, $200K ARR: Dec 2027

# APPENDIX C: Partner Revenue Model

## How Partners Make Money

### Revenue Streams
| Source | Partner Share | Example (Year 1) |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Agent subscription | 70-85% | $350K |
| Per-debate fees | 60-75% | $150K |
| Data onboarding (if partner-led) | 10-15% passive | $50K |
| Human engagement upsells | 100% | $500K |
| **Total** | | **$1.05M** |

### vs. Traditional Model
- Traditional: 100 clients × $1M = $100M (human-constrained)
- With Agent9: 100 human + 5,000 agent = $100M + $1M agent + $25M upsell = **$126M**
