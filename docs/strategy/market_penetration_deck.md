# SLIDE 2: The Problem

## Enterprise Decision-Making is Broken

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Consulting is slow** | 12-24 weeks for strategic insights |
| **Consulting is expensive** | $500K-$2M minimum engagements |
| **One perspective** | Single firm's bias, no debate |
| **No audit trail** | "Trust us" doesn't satisfy boards |
| **IP walks out the door** | Knowledge leaves with consultants |

> **"By the time we get the analysis, the market has moved."**

# SLIDE 8: Market Segmentation

## Who We're Targeting

| Segment | Size | ARPU | Priority |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| **PE Portfolio Ops** | 500 firms | $200K+ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Mid-Market CFOs** | 10,000+ | $80K | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Corp Strategy Teams** | 500 F500 | $300K+ | ⭐⭐ |
| **Data Platform Customers** | 5,000+ | $100K | ⭐⭐ |
| **Consulting Firms (internal)** | 100 | $200K+ | ⭐⭐ |

### Why These Segments?

---

---

# SLIDE 11: Partner Strategy

## Why Partners Will Join

### The Revenue Erosion Reframe

| Fear | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "We'll cannibalize our revenue" | Access markets you can't serve today |
| "Our IP will be commoditized" | Monetize IP that's currently free |
| "Clients won't need us" | Agents generate leads for human work |

### Partner Economics

| Metric | Traditional | With Agent9 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Clients served/year | 50-100 | 5,000+ |
| Revenue per client | $500K-$2M | $5K-$50K (entry) + upsell |
| IP monetization | $0 | $500K+/year passive |
| **Total Revenue** | $100M | **$120M+ (+20%)** |

---

# SLIDE 12: Partner Tiers

## Structured Partnership Program

| Tier | Profile | Investment | Benefits |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Strategic** | Top 10 firms, cloud vendors | $37.5K + methodology | 75% subsidy, exclusivity, co-marketing |
| **Innovation** | Mid-tier, boutiques, ISVs | $150K | Standard pricing, marketplace listing |
| **Ecosystem** | Independents, experts | Self-serve | Revenue share, community support |

### Pilot Program: 14 Weeks
1. **Discovery (2 wks)** — Map methodology to agent capabilities
2. **Build (6 wks)** — Develop branded agent with partner IP
3. **Validate (6 wks)** — Pilot with 3-5 mutual customers

# SLIDE 13: Competitive Landscape

## We're Creating a New Category

| Player | What They Do | Gap |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| **McKinsey/BCG/Bain** | Human consulting | Slow, expensive, no scale |
| **ChatGPT/Claude** | Generic AI | No expertise, no audit trail |
| **Palantir** | Data platform | No consulting methodology |
| **Tableau/Power BI** | Dashboards | Shows data, doesn't advise |
| **Dataiku/Alteryx** | ML platforms | Technical, not strategic |

# SLIDE 14: Defensibility

## Our Moat Deepens Over Time

| Moat | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Partner Network** | More partners → more expertise → more customers → more partners |
| **Data Network** | More customers → more data patterns → better recommendations |
| **Methodology Encoding** | Partner IP encoded in agents is sticky, hard to replicate |
| **Audit Trail Standard** | First to define what "explainable AI consulting" looks like |
| **Switching Costs** | Data onboarding, workflow integration, user training |

### Flywheel Effect
```
Partners encode IP → Customers get value → 
More customers attract partners → 
More partners attract customers → 
Platform becomes standard
```
