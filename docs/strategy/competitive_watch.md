# Agent9 Competitive Watch
**Last Updated:** February 13, 2026

## 1. Methodology Comparison

| **Capability** | **Agent9** | **Consulting Firms** | **Cloud Providers** | **AI Finance Startups** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Problem Framing | OODA+Cynefin hybrid | SCQA/Hypothesis-driven | Anomaly detection | Domain templates |
| Decision Analysis | KT-inspired matrices | Human judgment | Basic metric explanation | Narrow financial models |
| Multi-Agent Debate | Protocol-governed, auditable | None | Basic multi-agent (no debate) | None |
| Registry Context | KPIs, principals, processes, data products | Manual/tribal knowledge | None | Limited (financial only) |
| Audit Trails | Full protocol traces | Slide decks | Limited query history | Transaction logs |

---

## 2. Cloud Agent Platforms (Commoditization Risk)

Multi-agent orchestration is becoming infrastructure. These are NOT direct competitors but represent the biggest strategic risk.

- **AWS Bedrock Agents** - GA. Agent9 adds domain intelligence Bedrock lacks.
- **Azure AI Agent Service** - GA. Same gap: no registry, no consulting methodology.
- **Google Vertex AI Agents** - GA. Lacks enterprise registry depth.
- **LangGraph / CrewAI / AutoGen** - Open-source, maturing fast. Potential building blocks, not competitors.

**Strategic implication:** Orchestration is commodity by Q4 2027. Agent9's moat is the registry-driven domain model, not the orchestration layer.

## 3. AI Finance Startups (Direct Competitors)

These target the same ICP (mid-market CFOs, PE ops) with well-funded teams.

| Startup | Funding | Focus | Threat | Agent9 Differentiation |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|----------------------|
| **Hebbia** | $130M | AI analyst for PE/finance | High | Document-centric vs Agent9 data-centric with live KPI monitoring |
| **Runway Financial** | $60M+ | AI-driven FP&A | Medium | Narrow FP&A scope vs strategic advisory |
| **Mosaic** | $48M | Strategic finance platform | Medium | Overlaps on CFO persona; Agent9 adds multi-perspective debate |
| **Numeric** | $28M | AI financial close | Low | Financial close != strategic decision intelligence |
| **Clockwork** | $25M | AI financial modeling | Low | Modeling tool, not advisory platform |
| **Rogo** | $22M | AI research analyst | Medium | Research-focused; Agent9 goes to recommendation and action |

**Strategic implication:** CFO/PE space is crowded. Differentiate on multi-perspective analysis, registry context, and audit trails.

---

## 4. Consulting Firms (Indirect Competitors)

Building AI internally but NOT productizing for mid-market.

| Firm | AI Initiative | Threat | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------|-------|
| **McKinsey** | Lilli (30K+ internal users), QuantumBlack expanding | Medium | Won't serve $500M-$2B companies with AI tools |
| **BCG** | BCG X agentic AI capabilities | Medium | Building for own delivery, not a marketplace |
| **Deloitte** | AI-powered audit/advisory in production | Medium | Focuses on large enterprise |
| **Accenture** | $3B+ AI investment | Low | Serves F500 only |

**Strategic implication:** 18-24 month window before consulting firms expand AI downmarket. Agent9 must establish mid-market position before then.

---

## 5. BI/Analytics + AI (Adjacent)

- **Tableau + Einstein** - Explains "what happened" but doesn't advise "what to do"
- **Power BI + Copilot** - Narration without recommendation. Agent9 coexistence strategy is correct.
- **ThoughtSpot** - Analytics tool, not advisory platform

---

## 6. Bridge Component Roadmap (Deferred)

*Original Q2-Q4 2026 timeline deferred. Bridge components are Year 2+ priorities after first paying customers.*

| Priority | Component | Purpose | Timeline |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | LLM Provider Abstraction | Support Claude/GPT/Gemini interchangeably | H2 2027 |
| 2 | BI Embed Adapter | Insight cards in Tableau/Power BI | H1 2028 |
| 3 | Cloud Agent Bridge | Map Agent9 protocols to Bedrock/Azure | H2 2028 |

---

## 7. Tracking Table

| Competitor | Last Updated | Key Moves | Agent9 Countermeasures |
|---|---|---|---|
| McKinsey | 2026-Q1 | Lilli scaling to 30K+ users; QuantumBlack expanding AI delivery | Focus on mid-market they ignore; defer partnership outreach to Year 3+ |
| BCG | 2026-Q1 | BCG X building agentic AI; published AI adoption frameworks | Monitor but do not engage until 10+ customers |
| AWS | 2026-Q1 | Bedrock multi-agent orchestration GA; QuickSight AI integration | Shift differentiation to domain intelligence; consider building ON Bedrock |
| Hebbia | 2026-Q1 | $130M raised; expanding PE/finance AI analyst | Differentiate on live data (vs documents), multi-agent debate, registry depth |
| Runway | 2026-Q1 | FP&A automation expanding to mid-market | Differentiate on strategic advisory vs operational finance |
| OpenAI | 2026-Q1 | GPT-5 expected mid-2026; agent capabilities expanding | Protocol-aware integration; domain model is the moat, not the LLM |

## 8. Key Competitive Insights

1. **Multi-agent orchestration has ~12 months of differentiation left.** By Q4 2027, every cloud platform will offer it natively.
2. **Registry-driven domain intelligence is the durable moat.** No competitor has KPI registries, principal profiles, business process mappings, and data product contracts in a unified model.
3. **The "agentic consulting marketplace" positioning is premature.** Year 1 positioning should be "AI Decision Intelligence for CFOs"  a vertical application, not a platform.
4. **Mid-tier consulting firms (FTI, A&M, Huron) are more realistic partners than BCG/McKinsey.** They lack internal AI capabilities and are more likely to engage with a startup.
5. **First paying customer by September 2026 is the single most important competitive move.** Everything else is secondary.
