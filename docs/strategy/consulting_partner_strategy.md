# Agent9: Consulting Partner Strategy

**Last Updated:** February 2026
**Status:** Pre-activation — prerequisites not yet met. Activation planned for Year 3 (2028).

---

## Overview

Agent9's long-term revenue model includes a consulting firm partner channel. This document covers the strategy, framing, prerequisites, target partner profile, and activation timeline.

**Important:** This channel does not exist yet and should not be presented to prospects as a current capability. Premature partner conversations — before Agent9 has paying customers and a validated delivery track record — waste credibility and create false expectations on both sides.

---

## The Partner Model in One Sentence

Consulting firms partner with Agent9 to generate qualified leads among their mid-market clients and to protect their recurring revenue against the AI-driven displacement of traditional engagement work.

---

## Why Consulting Firms Will Eventually Want This

The consulting industry faces a structural threat it has not yet fully priced in: AI tools are beginning to compress the billable hours in the discovery, analysis, and reporting phases of engagements — exactly the phases that generate 60-70% of mid-tier firm revenue.

The firms most exposed are mid-tier generalists (FTI Consulting, Alvarez & Marsal, Huron, Navigant, Protiviti, West Monroe) who:
- Compete on analytical depth but cannot match the hourly rates of McKinsey or BCG
- Serve mid-market clients who are increasingly price-sensitive
- Cannot easily absorb the AI investment required to build proprietary tools
- Risk losing clients who adopt AI-native platforms and no longer need the analytical engagement work

**Agent9's value proposition to these firms is not "use our AI platform."** It is:

1. **Lead generation:** Every client using Agent9 generates a continuous stream of structured decision situations. When a situation exceeds what the platform handles automatically, Agent9 surfaces it as a consulting engagement opportunity — pre-qualified, pre-diagnosed, with supporting analysis ready. The firm closes faster on better-scoped work.

2. **Revenue assurance:** Firms that partner with Agent9 can shift from selling analytical hours to selling implementation, change management, and strategic advisory — the work that AI cannot replace. Agent9 becomes the diagnostic layer; the firm remains the delivery layer. Total client spend may be lower, but the firm's share of that spend on higher-margin work improves.

The framing that works: *"We help you survive the AI transition by making you the firm that adopted it, not the firm it displaced."*

The framing that doesn't work: *"Encode your methodology in our platform."* This creates anxiety about IP loss, competitive risk, and the implication that the firm is making itself redundant.

## What the Partner Model Actually Looks Like

### What Partners Do

- Introduce Agent9 to mid-market clients they can't serve cost-effectively with traditional engagements
- Refer clients to Agent9 for the always-on monitoring and diagnostic layer
- Retain the implementation, change management, and strategic advisory work that Agent9 surfaces but doesn't execute
- Optionally configure domain-specific analysis templates based on their methodologies (not full methodology encoding)

### What Agent9 Provides

- **Lead attribution tracking:** Every Agent9 situation that converts to a consulting engagement is logged, tracked, and attributed back to the referring partner
- **Revenue share:** Partners earn a percentage of Agent9 subscription revenue from clients they refer (TBD at negotiation; likely 10-20% of Year 1 platform subscription)
- **White-label option (Phase 4):** Branded reporting and situation cards that carry the firm's visual identity
- **Priority support:** Dedicated onboarding lane for partner-referred clients

### What Partners Do NOT Do

- Encode proprietary methodologies as licensed agents (this is Phase 4+ and requires significant trust to have been established)
- Control Agent9's analysis output or override its frameworks
- Restrict Agent9 from working with other clients or competing firms

### Client Data Architecture

**Opt-in by design:** Partners never have access to client data unless the client explicitly grants it. The partner sees only aggregate lead attribution and engagement referral data. Individual client analysis, KPI data, and decision audit trails are client-owned and client-controlled. This is non-negotiable — it is the governance architecture that makes clients comfortable with a firm having a partner relationship with Agent9 in the first place.

## Target Partner Profile

### Tier 1: Boutique FP&A and Finance Advisory Specialists *(First Target)*

These are the first and most natural partners:

| Firm Type | Why They Partner | Agent9 Gives Them |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Regional FP&A advisory boutiques | Too small to build AI tools; compete with larger firms | AI-native offering to win mid-market mandates |
| CFO advisory and interim CFO services | Work inside companies during transition periods | Always-on monitoring as a leave-behind after engagement |
| Finance transformation specialists | Implementation expertise without AI diagnostic layer | Qualified leads for implementation work |

**Why start here:** Boutique firms have faster decision cycles, less IP anxiety, and the partner conversation is with the founder — not a committee. First 2-3 partner relationships should be boutique specialists.

### Tier 2: Mid-Tier Generalists *(Year 3+ Target)*

These firms have the scale and client relationships to drive meaningful volume:

| Firm | Revenue (~) | Mid-Market Exposure | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------------------|----|
| Huron Consulting Group | ~$950M | Strong (healthcare, higher ed, life sciences) | Active in AI-adjacent work |
| FTI Consulting | ~$3.5B | Strong (economic consulting, restructuring) | Known for data-driven advisory |
| Alvarez & Marsal | ~$2.5B | Strong (performance improvement, private equity) | PE portfolio exposure = Agent9 fit |
| Protiviti | ~$1.8B | Strong (internal audit, risk) | Risk + compliance = Agent9 Pillar 3 |
| West Monroe | ~$800M | Strong (technology + operations) | Digital transformation clients |
| Navigant (now Guidehouse) | ~$700M | Strong (government, healthcare) | Regulated industry = audit trail value |

**Why wait for Tier 2:** Enterprise sales cycles at these firms are 6-18 months. Partnership conversations require champion at VP/Principal level, legal review of data sharing agreements, and a proven track record Agent9 doesn't have yet. Starting too early wastes time and positions Agent9 as unproven.

### Tier 3: Big 4 and Top-Tier Strategy Firms *(Not the Target)*

McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG — not the right partners:

- Serve large enterprise (Agent9's Phase 3+ market at earliest)
- Have significant AI investment in proprietary tools
- Would require Agent9 to be scaled and proven before conversations are meaningful
- Risk of partner becoming acquirer (different from lead generation partnership)
- Enterprise clients require the firm's brand, not Agent9's brand

The opportunity with these firms is eventual — not imminent.

## Prerequisites Before Activating Partner Conversations

These gates must be met before investing time in partner conversations:

| Gate | Target Date | Why Required |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 3+ paying customers with documented ROI | Dec 2027 | Partners won't refer clients to unproven platforms |
| $200K+ ARR | Dec 2027 | Signals commercial viability to partner risk committees |
| At least 1 published case study | Jan 2027 | Partners need a story to tell clients |
| Lead attribution tracking infrastructure built | Jun 2027 | Must be able to track and pay partner revenue share |
| Agent9 team has bandwidth for partner support | Jun 2027 | Partners will generate support demands before revenue |
| Fast Start process validated and documented | Oct 2026 | Partners will promise clients quick deployment |
| Legal: data sharing agreement template reviewed | H1 2028 | Required before any client data is adjacent to a partner |

**Do not begin partner outreach until gates 1, 2, and 3 are met.** The conversations will go nowhere and may create awkward dynamics if encountered later as a paying customer's consulting firm.

## Infrastructure Agent9 Needs to Build (Year 1-2)

These are not partner-facing features — they are the internal tracking infrastructure that makes a partner model possible later:

### Lead Attribution Tracking (Build in Phase 1)

- Log every consulting engagement that originates from an Agent9 situation card
- Track: situation ID → engagement type → consulting firm → engagement value
- Purpose: When partners ask "how much revenue have you sent us?" — we have the answer
- **This is the data that will close early partner conversations.** Showing a partner that Agent9 has already generated $2M in qualified consulting leads for their client base is more persuasive than any deck.

### Partner Portal (Build in Phase 2)

- Simple dashboard: referred clients, attributed engagements, revenue share earned
- Not a complex product — a clean reporting layer on top of the attribution tracking data
- Partners should be able to see their referral pipeline without needing Agent9 to run a report

### Data Sharing Agreement Template (Legal, Phase 2)

- What data flows to partners: engagement attribution only (no client data)
- Client consent architecture: explicit opt-in for any data sharing beyond attribution
- IP ownership: Agent9 owns the platform; client owns their data; partner owns their methodology
- Must be reviewed before first signed partner agreement

---

## The Partner Conversation Arc

**Year 1-2 (Pre-activation):** Do not pitch partners. Instead, note which consulting firms your pilot customers use. Begin relationship-building conversations framed as "we'd love to understand how you currently serve this market" — not "partner with us."

**Year 2-3 (Early conversations):** With 2-3 case studies and attribution data in hand, begin informal conversations with boutique FP&A advisors. Frame as: "We've been generating consulting engagement leads for your peers. We'd like to formalize this."

**Year 3 (First signed partner):** Target one boutique FP&A specialist for a 12-month pilot partnership. Measure: referrals sent, conversions, revenue share paid, client NPS with Agent9 vs without.

**Year 3-4 (Mid-tier conversations):** With a boutique partnership validated, approach Tier 2 firms. The conversation is now backed by referral data, a partner who can vouch for the model, and a commercial track record.

**Year 4+ (Marketplace):** If and when branded agent configuration makes sense (Phase 4), structure it as an opt-in enhancement for partners who want their methodology reflected in the analysis framing — not as a requirement or as IP transfer.

## What Success Looks Like

### Year 3 (First partner signed)
- 1 boutique FP&A advisory firm as a formal referral partner
- Revenue share: 10-15% of first-year platform subscription for referred clients
- Attribution data showing 3-5 consulting engagements sourced from Agent9 situations

### Year 4 (Channel developing)
- 3-5 boutique partners active
- 1 Tier 2 firm in conversation
- Partner channel contributing 15-20% of new logo acquisition
- Partners actively using "Agent9-powered" as a differentiator in their pitches

### Year 5+ (Channel mature)
- 2-3 Tier 2 mid-market consulting firm partnerships signed
- Partner channel contributing 25-35% of new logo acquisition
- Revenue share paid to partners becoming material ($200K-$500K/year)
- Consulting firm ecosystem creating defensibility against direct competition from new AI entrants

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Partners position Agent9 as a replacement for themselves | Medium | Explicit framing: Agent9 is diagnostic; partners are delivery |
| Partner client data inadvertently exposed | Low | Strict opt-in architecture; no partner portal access to client data |
| Partner refers low-quality clients who churn | Medium | Onboarding gate: data readiness assessment required |
| Large consulting firm acquires a competitor | Low-Medium | First-mover partner relationships create switching cost |
| Partner expects revenue share before Agent9 is generating leads | High in early conversations | Set expectations explicitly: first 12 months relationship-building only |
| Partners use Agent9 pitch to buy time while building internal AI | Medium | Track partner engagement frequency; re-evaluate at 12-month marks |

## What This Document Is Not

This is not a partnership pitch deck. It is not a term sheet. It is not a commitment that Agent9 will build the marketplace, the branded agent infrastructure, or the revenue share mechanism on any specific timeline.

This document is the strategic rationale for why consulting firm partnerships are worth building toward — and the preconditions that must be true before the investment is justified.
