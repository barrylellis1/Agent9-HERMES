# Agent9 Partner Outreach Materials

## Consulting-as-a-Service (CaaS) Partnership Program

---

## Executive Summary

Agent9 is building the first **agentic consulting marketplace**—a platform where consulting firms and technology providers can deploy their proprietary methodologies as AI-powered agents, monetize them at scale, and participate in collaborative solution debates.

We're seeking innovation-minded partners to co-develop branded agents and validate the CaaS model through structured pilots.

## The Opportunity

### Market Context
- **Global consulting market:** $800B+ annually
- **BI/analytics market:** $100B+ annually
- **Digital consulting gap:** No true agentic CaaS marketplace exists

### The Problem We Solve

| Traditional Consulting | Agent9 CaaS |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Human-delivered, expensive | AI-augmented, scalable |
| 6-12 month engagements | On-demand, hours to days |
| IP trapped in slide decks | IP encoded, monetizable |
| One firm's perspective | Multi-agent debates, best-of-breed |
| Limited audit trail | Full provenance, compliance-ready |
