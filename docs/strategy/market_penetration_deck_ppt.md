### Title
**Agent9**

### Subtitle
The Agentic Consulting Marketplace

### Tagline
Transforming $800B of consulting into on-demand, AI-powered expertise

### Footer

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

## SLIDE 2: The Problem
**Layout:** Title and Content

### Title
Enterprise Decision-Making is Broken

### Content (5 bullet points with icons)
- ⏱️ **Consulting is slow** — 12-24 weeks for strategic insights
- 💰 **Consulting is expensive** — $500K-$2M minimum engagements  
- 👁️ **Single perspective** — One firm's bias, no debate
- 📋 **No audit trail** — "Trust us" doesn't satisfy boards
- 🚪 **IP walks out** — Knowledge leaves with consultants

### Quote Box (bottom)
> "By the time we get the analysis, the market has moved."
> — Fortune 500 CFO

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Let me paint the picture of what enterprises face today. They're paying millions for insights that arrive months late. They get one firm's perspective with no way to verify the reasoning. And when the engagement ends, all that knowledge walks out the door. This is a $800 billion market that's ripe for disruption.

## SLIDE 3: The Opportunity
**Layout:** Title and Content (with comparison visual)

### Title
$800B Market, Zero Agentic Players

### Three-Column Comparison

| Traditional Consulting | AI Tools (ChatGPT) | Agent9 CaaS |
|:----------------------:|:------------------:|:-----------:|
| ✅ Expertise | ✅ Speed | ✅ **Both** |
| ✅ Trust | ✅ Cost | ✅ **Both** |
| ❌ Speed | ❌ Expertise | ✅ **Both** |
| ❌ Cost | ❌ Trust | ✅ **Both** |
| ❌ Audit Trail | ❌ Audit Trail | ✅ **Both** |

### Key Message (bold, centered)
**No one has built the marketplace where branded consulting expertise meets AI scale.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Here's the gap in the market. Traditional consulting has expertise but lacks speed and affordability. Generic AI tools are fast and cheap but lack real expertise and accountability. Agent9 sits in the middle—we deliver branded expertise at AI speed with full audit trails. No one else is doing this.

## SLIDE 4: Our Solution

```

### Tagline (bottom, bold)
**Multiple expert perspectives. One synthesized recommendation. Complete audit trail.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Here's how Agent9 works. When a customer has a strategic question, they don't get one consultant's opinion—they get multiple branded AI agents, each trained on a firm's proprietary methodology, debating the problem. The platform synthesizes the best ideas and delivers a recommendation with a complete audit trail. Think of it as a board of expert advisors available on demand.

## SLIDE 5: How It Works
**Layout:** Comparison (two columns)

### Title
From Question to Decision in Hours, Not Months

### Two-Column Table

| Step | Traditional | Agent9 |
|------|:-----------:|:------:|
| 1. Frame Problem | 2-4 weeks | Minutes |
| 2. Gather Data | 4-8 weeks | Pre-connected |
| 3. Analyze | 4-8 weeks | Hours |
| 4. Debate Options | 2-4 weeks | Real-time |
| 5. Recommend | 2-4 weeks | Instant |
| 6. Document | 1-2 weeks | Automatic |
| **Total** | **12-24 weeks** | **4-24 hours** |

### Highlight Box
**10-50x faster. 70-90% cheaper.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Let's break down the timeline. Traditional consulting takes 3-6 months from kickoff to final recommendation. With Agent9, because we're pre-connected to customer data and our agents work in parallel, we compress that to hours. The documentation—which often takes weeks—is automatic because every step is logged.

## SLIDE 6: Platform Capabilities
**Layout:** Title and Content (three columns)

### Title
What We've Built

### Column 1: Core Workflows ✅
- Situation Awareness
- Deep Analysis
- Solution Finding with LLM Debate

### Column 2: Platform Features ✅
- Multi-agent Orchestration
- Full Audit Trail
- Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints
- Data Product Registry

### Column 3: Coming Soon 🔄
- Branded Agent Marketplace
- Decision Studio UI
- RAG Integration for Partner IP

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
We're not pitching a vision—we've built the core platform. Our orchestrator coordinates multiple agents through complete workflows. Every decision has an audit trail. Humans stay in the loop for critical approvals. What we're building next is the marketplace layer that lets partners bring their branded agents to customers.

## SLIDE 7: Business Model
**Layout:** Title and Content (with diagram)

### Title
Three-Sided Marketplace

### Diagram (SmartArt: Converging Radial)
```
        PARTNERS                    CUSTOMERS
        (Supply)                    (Demand)
        
    • Consulting firms           • Enterprises
    • Tech vendors               • PE portfolio cos
    • Domain experts             • Mid-market CFOs
    
            ↘                    ↙
                 ┌──────────┐
                 │  AGENT9  │
                 │ PLATFORM │
                 └──────────┘
```

### Revenue Streams (4 boxes)
| Platform Subscriptions | Per-Debate Fees | Implementation | Partner Rev Share |
|:----------------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
| $80K-$300K/year | $100-$500 each | $50K-$150K | 15-30% |

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Our business model is a three-sided marketplace. On the supply side, we have consulting firms and domain experts who bring their methodologies. On the demand side, enterprises who need strategic insights. Agent9 sits in the middle, earning revenue from platform subscriptions, per-debate transaction fees, implementation services, and a share of partner agent revenue.

## SLIDE 8: Target Market
**Layout:** Title and Content (with table)

### Title
Who We're Targeting

### Priority Segments Table

| Segment | Market Size | Avg. Deal | Priority |
|---------|:-----------:|:---------:|:--------:|
| PE Portfolio Ops | 500 firms | $200K+ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Mid-Market CFOs | 10,000+ | $80K | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Corp Strategy Teams | 500 F500 | $300K+ | ⭐⭐ |
| Data Platform Customers | 5,000+ | $100K | ⭐⭐ |

### Why These Segments? (4 icons)
- 📊 **Data-mature** — Already have clean data
- 😤 **Consulting fatigue** — Frustrated with status quo
- 💡 **Innovation mandate** — Budget to try new
- ✅ **Compliance need** — Value audit trails

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
We're targeting segments that are data-mature and frustrated with traditional consulting. PE portfolio ops teams are ideal—they have a mandate to improve operations across dozens of companies and they're tired of paying McKinsey $2M per portfolio company. Mid-market CFOs can't afford big consulting but desperately need strategic support.

---

## SLIDE 9: Ideal Customer Profile
**Layout:** Two Content (split slide)

### Title
The Perfect Early Adopter

### Left Column: Must-Haves ✅
- Existing data infrastructure (ERP, BI, warehouse)
- Analytics team to validate outputs
- Executive sponsor with innovation budget
- $1M+ annual consulting spend

### Right Column: Trigger Events 🎯
- New CFO/CSO hire (first 90 days)
- PE acquisition (value creation mandate)
- Activist investor pressure
- IPO preparation
- Cost reduction initiative

### Bottom Banner (red background)
**Avoid:** No data infrastructure | "Innovation theater" | Deep McKinsey relationships

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Our ideal customer already has data infrastructure—we're not building data warehouses. They have an analytics team who can validate our outputs. And they're spending at least a million a year on consulting, so the pain is real. The best trigger events are leadership changes, PE acquisitions, or cost-cutting mandates—moments when they're looking for new approaches.

## SLIDE 10: Go-to-Market Strategy
**Layout:** Title and Content (timeline/phases)

### Title
Land, Expand, Partner

### Three Phases (SmartArt: Process)

**Phase 1: LAND (Q1-Q2 2025)**
- Direct sales to 10-20 early adopters
- Target: PE portfolio ops, mid-market CFOs
- Goal: 5-10 customers, $500K ARR

**Phase 2: EXPAND (Q3-Q4 2025)**
- Grow within accounts, add use cases
- CFO → Strategy → Operations
- Goal: $150K avg ACV, $2M ARR

**Phase 3: PARTNER (2026)**
- Launch branded agent marketplace
- Onboard 3-5 consulting partners
- Goal: 50% revenue from partner channel

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Our go-to-market has three phases. First, we land 10-20 early adopters through direct sales—proving the model works. Then we expand within those accounts, adding use cases and users. Finally, we launch the partner marketplace, which becomes our primary growth engine. By 2026, we expect half our revenue to come through partners.

## SLIDE 11: Partner Strategy
**Layout:** Title and Content (comparison table)

### Title
Why Partners Will Join

### The Revenue Erosion Reframe

| Partner Fear | Agent9 Reality |
|--------------|----------------|
| "We'll cannibalize revenue" | Access markets you can't serve today |
| "Our IP will be commoditized" | Monetize IP that's currently free |
| "Clients won't need us" | Agents generate leads for human work |

### Partner Economics Comparison

| Metric | Traditional | With Agent9 |
|--------|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Clients served/year | 50-100 | 5,000+ |
| Revenue per client | $500K-$2M | $5K-$50K + upsell |
| IP monetization | $0 | $500K+/year |
| **Total Revenue** | $100M | **$120M+ (+20%)** |

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
The number one objection from partners is revenue cannibalization. Here's our reframe: Agent9 lets them access the mid-market—companies that can't afford a $500K engagement. These become qualified leads for human work. Plus, they're monetizing IP that's currently given away free in books and articles. Our modeling shows a 20%+ revenue increase, not erosion.

## SLIDE 12: Competitive Landscape

### Title
We're Creating a New Category

### Positioning Chart (2x2 matrix)

```

### Competitor Gaps (bottom)
| McKinsey/BCG | ChatGPT | Palantir |
|:------------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Slow, expensive | No expertise | No methodology |

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Let me show you where we sit competitively. Traditional consulting is high expertise but low scale—constrained by human capacity. Generic AI is high scale but low expertise—it doesn't know your business. Agent9 occupies the upper right quadrant: branded expertise at AI scale. No one else is there.

## SLIDE 13: Defensibility
**Layout:** Title and Content (with flywheel diagram)

### Title
Our Moat Deepens Over Time

### Five Moats (icons + text)
- 🤝 **Partner Network** — More partners → more expertise → more customers
- 📊 **Data Network** — More customers → better pattern recognition
- 🔒 **Methodology Lock-in** — Partner IP encoded, hard to replicate
- 📋 **Audit Standard** — First to define explainable AI consulting
- 🔄 **Switching Costs** — Data onboarding, workflow integration

### Flywheel Diagram (circular SmartArt)
```
Partners encode IP → Customers get value → 
More customers attract partners → 
More partners attract customers → 
Platform becomes standard
```

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Our defensibility comes from network effects. As we add partners, we have more expertise, which attracts more customers. As we add customers, we have more data patterns, which improves recommendations. Partner methodologies encoded in our platform create lock-in. And we're setting the standard for what explainable AI consulting looks like.

## SLIDE 14: Financial Projections
**Layout:** Title and Content (with chart)

### Title
Path to $10M+ ARR

### Revenue Table

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 |
|--------|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Customers | 15 | 50 | 150 |
| Avg. ACV | $100K | $120K | $130K |
| Platform ARR | $1.5M | $6M | $19.5M |
| Partner + Services | $0.5M | $1.5M | $3.5M |
| **Total Revenue** | **$2M** | **$7.5M** | **$23M** |

### Unit Economics (4 KPI boxes)

| CAC | LTV | LTV:CAC | Gross Margin |
|:---:|:---:|:-------:|:------------:|
| $30-50K | $300-500K | 8-10x | 75-80% |

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Here's our financial model. We're targeting 15 customers in year one at $100K average deal size, growing to 150 customers by year three. Our unit economics are strong—LTV to CAC ratio of 8-10x with 75-80% gross margins. This is a capital-efficient model because partners bring the expertise and customers bring the data.
