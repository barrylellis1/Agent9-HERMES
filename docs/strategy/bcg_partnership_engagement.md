# Agent9 Partnership Strategy

_Last updated: 2026-02-13_

## Executive Summary

**Strategic Shift:** Partnership strategy deferred to **Phase 3 (2028+)** after establishing 10+ paying customers and $600K+ ARR.

**Rationale:**
- MBB firms (McKinsey, BCG, Bain) are building internal AI capabilities and won't partner with pre-revenue startups
- **18-24 month window** exists before consulting firms expand AI downmarket
- Agent9 must prove direct customer value before pursuing partnerships
- **Application First, Platform Later** strategy prioritizes customer traction over marketplace complexity

**Revised Partnership Approach:**
- **Phase 1-2 (2026-2027):** Focus exclusively on direct customer acquisition
- **Phase 3 (2028+):** Explore partnerships with **mid-tier consulting firms** (FTI, A&M, Huron) who lack internal AI capabilities
- **MBB partnerships:** Deferred to Year 4+ or post-Series A

## 1. Original BCG Partnership Thesis (Archived for Future Reference)

**Status:** Deferred to Phase 3+

This document outlines a focused partnership thesis and engagement plan for approaching Boston Consulting Group (BCG), anchored in their publication **"How Agents Are Accelerating the Next Wave of AI Value Creation" (2025)** and Agent9's existing product and GTM strategy.

Original Goals:

- Position Agent9 as a **platform that operationalizes BCG's agentic AI roadmap**, not as a competitor.
- Define where BCG creates value (methodologies, sector expertise, change management) and where Agent9 creates value (agentic platform, registry, auditability, multi-LLM orchestration).
- Propose a **practical first engagement**: a co-designed pilot in finance / PE portfolio operations.

## 2. Strategic Alignment with BCG Article

BCG’s article lays out a **Now / Next / Always** framework for the “agentic age”:

- **Now – Three moves**
  - Redesign work around **zero-based, outcome-driven processes**.
  - **Embed business context and proprietary intelligence** into agents.
  - Assemble a **shared AI platform** that offers “freedom within a frame.”

- **Next – Two disruptions**
  - A **radically altered operating model** as agents take on execution.
  - A **recalibrated tech strategy** as platform dependencies deepen.

- **Always – Five enduring principles**
  - Focus on a few **“reshape and invent” big bets**.
  - Combine **predictive + generative + agentic** AI.
  - Follow the **10/20/70 rule** (10% tech, 20% data, 70% people/process).
  - Make the transformation **business-led**.
  - Invest in a **robust, improving data foundation**.

### 2.1 Where Agent9 Is Aligned

- **Outcome- and workflow-centric**
  - Agent9’s core flows (Situation Awareness → Deep Analysis → Solution Finder) are designed as **end-to-end agentic workflows**, not point features.
  - This matches BCG’s emphasis on redesigning **entire processes**, not isolated tasks.

- **Embedded proprietary context**
  - Agent9’s **registries** (Data Products, KPIs, Principals, Business Processes, Business Glossary) encode the client’s **institutional knowledge and data semantics**.
  - This implements BCG’s call to embed **business context + proprietary intelligence** in agents.

- **Shared AI platform / “freedom within a frame”**
  - The **orchestrator, A2A protocol, registry-driven configuration, and Decision Studio UI** form a reusable, governed platform for multi-agent workflows.
  - Teams get “freedom within a frame” via configuration rather than bespoke builds.

- **Data foundation and governance**
  - Agent9’s roadmap includes **Change, Data Quality, and Data Governance Agents**, plus registry-driven data product governance.
  - This supports BCG’s requirement for a **robust data foundation** and clear governance.

### 2.2 Differentiating Elements

- **Consulting-as-a-Service (CaaS) marketplace**
  - Agent9 is not only enabling enterprises to use agents; it is building a **marketplace for branded consulting agents**.
  - BCG (and other firms) can publish **BCG-branded agents** that encode their IP and methodologies, with IP protection and revenue sharing.

- **Multi-LLM orchestration**
  - Agent9’s **Divine Specialization** model (Athena/Apollo/Hermes) and multi-LLM debate protocol provide a **vendor-agnostic, de-risking layer**.
  - This addresses BCG’s concerns about deepening **platform dependencies** while still leveraging frontier models.

## 3. Partnership Thesis

**Core hypothesis:**  
BCG brings **trusted strategy, sector expertise, and change management**. Agent9 brings an **agentic execution platform** that turns BCG playbooks into **scalable, auditable, multi-agent workflows**.

### 3.1 Value to BCG

- **New revenue streams**
  - Productized **BCG-branded agents** (e.g., CFO turnaround agent, PE value creation agent) deployed across multiple clients.
  - Subscription and usage-based revenue via Agent9’s CaaS marketplace.

- **Faster, repeatable client impact**
  - Pre-integrated, **YAML/registry-driven templates** for key CFO / PE use cases reduce implementation time.
  - Built-in **audit trails and explainability** support risk and compliance concerns.

- **Platform risk mitigation**
  - Agent9’s **multi-LLM, protocol-based architecture** reduces single-vendor AI lock-in, aligning with BCG’s guidance on tech strategy.

### 3.2 Value to Agent9

- **Brand validation**
  - Association with BCG’s **CEO agenda** and thought leadership in agentic AI.
- **Distribution**
  - Access to BCG’s existing **C-suite and PE client base**.
- **Methodology depth**
  - Ability to formalize BCG frameworks as **first-class agentic workflows** (e.g., portfolio diagnostics, cost programs, growth strategies).

## 4. Engagement Model

### 4.1 Roles and Boundaries

- **BCG**
  - Owns and curates **methodologies, sector playbooks, and change programs**.
  - Leads **client relationship, design of interventions, and operating model redesign**.
  - Defines which **BCG-branded agents** are made available, and under what commercial/usage terms.

- **Agent9**
  - Provides the **agentic platform**:
    - Multi-agent debate orchestration.
    - Registries for data products, KPIs, principals, processes.
    - Decision Studio UI + Registry Explorer.
  - Ensures **multi-LLM support, observability, governance, and auditability**.
  - Co-designs technical **templates and agent cards** based on BCG’s methods.

### 4.2 Initial Pilot Concept

**Domain:** CFO and PE portfolio operations  
**Example journeys:**

- **Financial performance turnaround**
  - Situation Awareness Agent: codify the current performance situation from data and narrative.
  - Deep Analysis Agent: run BCG-style root-cause and scenario analysis.
  - Solution Finder Agent: propose levers and initiatives, linked to data products and KPIs in the registry.
  - All steps audited and linked to a **Principal (CFO) profile** and registry metadata.

- **Value creation planning for PE portfolio**
  - Registry-driven view of data products / KPIs per portfolio company.
  - Agentic workflows that encode BCG’s value creation playbooks into **repeatable debate and recommendation flows**.

### 4.3 Phased Engagement

1. **Discovery / Capability Alignment (0–1 month)**
   - 1–2 working sessions with BCG X / AI leadership and relevant practice partners.
   - Map BCG’s “Now / Next / Always” priorities to specific Agent9 capabilities.

2. **Design + Pilot Build (1–3 months)**
   - Co-design **one flagship journey** (e.g., CFO turnaround) as a BCG-branded agentic workflow.
   - Implement this on Agent9 with **registry-backed configuration** and Decision Studio UI.
   - Run pilot at 1–2 jointly selected clients.

3. **Scale and Productization (3–12 months)**
   - Convert pilot into **standardized BCG offerings** on Agent9.
   - Expand library of BCG-branded agents across sectors (e.g., TMT, Financial Institutions, Industrial).

## 5. Outreach Strategy

### 5.1 Target Stakeholders

- **BCG X / AI Leadership**
  - Owners of the "agentic AI" platform and tools agenda.
  - Likely among or adjacent to the article’s co-authors.

- **Practice Leaders in Target Verticals**
  - Principal Investors & Private Equity.
  - CFO / Finance transformation.
  - Sector practices where agentic workflows are a natural fit (e.g., TMT, consumer, industrial).

### 5.2 Positioning in Outreach

Key messages to include in outreach (email / LinkedIn / deck):

- **Reference point**
  - Directly reference *“How Agents Are Accelerating the Next Wave of AI Value Creation”* and the **Now / Next / Always** framework.

- **Agent9 as execution platform**
  - "Agent9 is a working implementation of the agentic AI roadmap you describe: outcome-driven workflows, embedded context, shared AI platform, and multi-LLM orchestration."

- **Partnership posture**
  - Emphasize that Agent9:
    - **Amplifies BCG IP and delivery**, rather than replacing consulting.
    - Provides a **governed platform** for BCG-branded agents and client deployments.

- **Concrete next step**
  - Propose a **30-minute capability exploration + demo** around one CFO/PE use case.
  - Offer to co-design a **joint pilot** with BCG leading client transformation and Agent9 providing the platform.

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

- **Perception of competition with consulting**
  - *Risk:* BCG perceives Agent9 as an "AI consultant" competitor.
  - *Mitigation:* Consistently position Agent9 as a **platform and marketplace** that requires and elevates **human/firm expertise**.

- **Platform dependency concerns**
  - *Risk:* BCG wary of committing to a new platform.
  - *Mitigation:* Highlight **multi-LLM, standards-based, registry-driven** design that reduces lock-in and allows co-existence with client stacks.

- **IP control and governance**
  - *Risk:* Concerns about BCG IP leakage or uncontrolled agent behavior.
  - *Mitigation:* Design explicit **agent card metadata, registries, and governance controls** for BCG-branded agents (access control, logging, environment separation).
