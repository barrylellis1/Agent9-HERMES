# Agent9 MVP Tracer Bullet Development Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the phased development and testing process for the Agent9 MVP using a tracer bullet approach. The initial build will deliver an end-to-end vertical slice (tracer bullet) through the stack, followed by iterative sprints that add agent functionality and depth.

---

## Phase 1: Baseline & Environment Setup
- [ ] Audit codebase for reusable utilities and patterns
- [ ] Validate access to SAP Datasphere CSV test data via `AGENT9_TEST_DATA_PATH`
- [ ] Validate access to YAML contracts in `src/contracts/`
- [ ] Ensure `.env` is configured (including `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- [ ] Confirm Material Admin Pro is installed and working for UI

---

## Phase 2: Tracer Bullet (Vertical Slice) Build
- [ ] Define minimal end-to-end workflow (Situation Awareness → Data Product → Decision Studio UI)
- [ ] Implement basic data loader using CSV and YAML contract
- [ ] Implement minimal Situation Awareness Agent (stub logic)
    - [ ] Deliver agent code
    - [ ] Deliver test harnesses
- [ ] Implement minimal Data Product Agent (stub logic)
    - [ ] Deliver agent code
    - [ ] Deliver test harnesses
- [ ] Implement Decision Studio UI shell using Material Admin Pro
- [ ] Integrate UI with backend to display loaded data
- [ ] Validate vertical slice with real test data
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for tracer bullet

---

## Phase 3: Agent Functionality Sprints
### Sprint 1: Core Agents
- [ ] Implement full Situation Awareness Agent (per PRD)
    - [ ] Deliver agent code
    - [ ] Deliver test harnesses
- [ ] Implement Deep Analysis Agent (per PRD)
    - [ ] Deliver agent code
    - [ ] Deliver test harnesses
- [ ] Implement Solution Finder Agent (per PRD)
    - [ ] Deliver agent code
    - [ ] Deliver test harnesses
- [ ] Implement Principal Context Agent (per PRD)
    - [ ] Deliver agent code
    - [ ] Deliver test harnesses
- [ ] Implement Data Governance Agent (per PRD)
    - [ ] Deliver agent code
    - [ ] Deliver test harnesses
- [ ] Implement Data Product Agent (full logic, per PRD)
    - [ ] Deliver agent code
    - [ ] Deliver test harnesses

### Sprint 2: NLP & LLM Integration
- [ ] Implement NLP Interface Agent (per PRD)
    - [ ] Deliver agent code
    - [ ] Deliver test harnesses
- [ ] Integrate LLM Service Agent using OpenAI API key
    - [ ] Deliver agent code
    - [ ] Deliver test harnesses
- [ ] Implement HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) features in Decision Studio UI

### Sprint 3: Advanced UI & Orchestration
- [ ] Expand Decision Studio UI with full Material Admin Pro features
- [ ] Integrate all agent APIs and workflows
- [ ] Implement audit logging, error handling, and compliance checks
- [ ] Add advanced user flows and UI polish

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Evaluation
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for all agents and UI components
- [ ] Write integration and regression tests using SAP CSV data and YAML contracts
- [ ] Validate protocol and config compliance (A2A)
- [ ] Run MVP evaluation rubric (performance, correctness, compliance, UX)
- [ ] Optimize for speed, reliability, and maintainability

---

## Phase 5: Documentation & Handoff
- [ ] Document all APIs, configs, data flows, and test coverage
- [ ] Prepare README and implementation notes
- [ ] Review with user and incorporate feedback
- [ ] Prepare for user acceptance testing

---

## Notes
- All UI/UX should align with provided wireframes and Agent PRD documents
- All data access and validation must use environment variables and YAML contracts
- No major changes or new patterns without explicit review/approval
- Frequent checkpoints and reviews with user
- **Start date and time:** 7/20 at 10:06 am
