# Stakeholder Analysis Agent PRD

## Overview

The Stakeholder Analysis Agent provides comprehensive stakeholder analysis capabilities for Agent9. It identifies, categorizes, and analyzes stakeholders across different types (customers, employees, partners, regulators, investors, suppliers) to support business change initiatives and decision-making processes.

## Features

### Core Functionality

1. **Stakeholder Identification and Categorization**
   - Categorize stakeholders by type (customer, employee, partner, regulator, investor, supplier)
   - Assign impact levels (low, medium, high, critical)
   - Track stakeholder size and domain ownership

2. **Stakeholder Analysis**
   - Analyze stakeholders by type with specialized analysis for each category
   - Generate comprehensive stakeholder maps
   - Calculate stakeholder impact scores
   - Provide actionable recommendations based on analysis

3. **Engagement Workflow Management**
   - Start guided engagement workflows for stakeholders
   - Support workflow templates for data governance and process ownership
   - Track workflow steps and progress
   - Record engagement outcomes

4. **Domain and Owner Mapping**
   - Map stakeholders to data domains and process domains
   - Track domain ownership
   - Support cross-domain stakeholder analysis

### Integration Points

1. **Event-Driven Handoff**
   - Emit StakeholderAnalysisCompleted events for downstream agents
   - Support event-based integration with Stakeholder Engagement Agent

2. **Registry Integration**
   - Orchestrator-controlled instantiation via AgentRegistry
   - Support for agent_id tracking and registry-based lookup

3. **Context Propagation**
   - Support for situation context from upstream agents
   - Maintain context throughout analysis process

## Technical Requirements

### Data Models

1. **Input Models**
   - StakeholderAnalysisInput: Contains stakeholder segments by type and situation context

2. **Output Models**
   - StakeholderAnalysisResult: Contains analyzed stakeholders, score, and recommendations
   - StakeholderAnalysisCompletedEvent: Event model for downstream agent handoff

3. **Domain Models**
   - StakeholderType: Enumeration of stakeholder types
   - StakeholderImpact: Enumeration of impact levels
   - StakeholderSegment: Core stakeholder data model
   - EngagementWorkflowStep: Model for workflow steps
   - EngagementWorkflowState: Model for workflow state tracking
   - EngagementOutcome: Model for workflow outcomes
   - StakeholderDomainOwnerMap: Model for domain-owner mapping

### Configuration

1. **Agent Configuration**
   - Validated via A9StakeholderAnalysisAgentConfig Pydantic model
   - Support for debug and logging configuration

### Error Handling

1. **Logging**
   - Comprehensive error logging via A9_SharedLogger
   - Context-aware error reporting

2. **Validation**
   - Input validation using Pydantic models
   - Configuration validation at instantiation

## User Experience

### Inputs

1. **Stakeholder Data**
   - Support for structured stakeholder data input
   - Support for situation context from upstream agents

### Outputs

1. **Analysis Results**
   - Stakeholder map with categorization and impact assessment
   - Numerical score representing overall stakeholder landscape
   - Actionable recommendations for stakeholder engagement

2. **Workflow Management**
   - Workflow creation and tracking
   - Step progression and outcome recording

## Implementation Details

### Agent Creation

The agent follows the orchestrator-controlled instantiation pattern:

```python
stakeholder_agent = await AgentRegistry.get_agent("A9_Stakeholder_Analysis_Agent")
result = await stakeholder_agent.analyze(input_data, change_context)
```

### Analysis Process

1. Stakeholder data is provided via StakeholderAnalysisInput
2. Agent analyzes each stakeholder type present in the input
3. Results are aggregated into a comprehensive stakeholder map
4. Score is calculated based on stakeholder impact and other factors
5. Recommendations are generated based on analysis
6. StakeholderAnalysisCompletedEvent is emitted for downstream agents

### Workflow Management

1. Workflows are created for stakeholders with domain ownership
2. Workflow steps are tracked and progressed
3. Outcomes are recorded for auditability



## Hackathon Quick Start

### Development Environment Setup
- Clone the Agent9-Hackathon-Template repository
- Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
- Configure environment variables in .env file based on .env.template

### Key Files and Entry Points
- Main agent implementation: `src/agents/new/A9_Stakeholder_Analysis_Agent_Agent.py`
- Configuration model: `src/agents/new/agent_config_models.py`
- Agent card: `src/agents/new/cards/a9_stakeholder_analysis_agent_agent_card.py`

### Test Data Location
- Sample data available in `test-data/` directory
- Test harnesses in `test-harnesses/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrates with Agent Registry for orchestration
- Follows A2A protocol for agent communication
- Uses shared logging utility for consistent error reporting

## Implementation Guidance

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Start with the agent's core functionality
2. Implement required protocol methods
3. Add registry integration
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Add validation and testing

### Core Functionality to Focus On
- Protocol compliance (A2A)
- Registry integration
- Error handling and logging
- Proper model validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock registry
- End-to-end tests with test harnesses

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Direct agent instantiation (use registry pattern)
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete logging
- Improper model validation

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Implementation
- Agent implements all required protocol methods
- Agent properly integrates with registry
- Agent handles errors and logs appropriately
- Agent validates inputs and outputs

### Stretch Goals
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features from Future Enhancements section

### Evaluation Metrics
- Protocol compliance
- Registry integration
- Error handling
- Logging quality
- Input/output validation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Sentiment analysis for stakeholder feedback
   - Predictive modeling for stakeholder behavior

2. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Direct integration with external stakeholder management systems
   - Real-time stakeholder feedback collection

3. **Visualization**
   - Stakeholder map visualization
   - Impact/influence matrix generation

## Compliance and Security

1. **Data Protection**
   - Stakeholder data is handled according to data governance policies
   - Sensitive stakeholder information is properly secured

2. **Auditability**
   - All stakeholder analysis actions are logged for audit purposes
   - Workflow progression and outcomes are tracked

## Dependencies
