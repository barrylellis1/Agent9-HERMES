## Hackathon Quick Start

### Development Environment Setup
- Clone the Agent9-Hackathon-Template repository
- Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
- Configure environment variables in .env file based on .env.template

### Key Files and Entry Points
- Main agent implementation: `src/agents/new/A9_Opportunity_Analysis_Agent_Agent.py`
- Configuration model: `src/agents/new/agent_config_models.py`
- Agent card: `src/agents/new/cards/a9_opportunity_analysis_agent_agent_card.py`

### Test Data Location
- Sample data available in `test-data/` directory
- Test harnesses in `test-harnesses/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrates with Agent Registry for orchestration
- Follows A2A protocol for agent communication
- Uses shared logging utility for consistent error reporting

## Implementation Guidance

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Start with the agent's core functionality
2. Implement required protocol methods
3. Add registry integration
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Add validation and testing

### Core Functionality to Focus On
- Protocol compliance (A2A)
- Registry integration
- Error handling and logging
- Proper model validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock registry
- End-to-end tests with test harnesses

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Direct agent instantiation (use registry pattern)
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete logging
- Improper model validation

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Implementation
- Agent implements all required protocol methods
- Agent properly integrates with registry
- Agent handles errors and logs appropriately
- Agent validates inputs and outputs

### Stretch Goals
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features from Future Enhancements section

### Evaluation Metrics
- Protocol compliance
- Registry integration
- Error handling
- Logging quality
- Input/output validation

## Compliance & Integration Update (2025-07-16)
- This agent is now fully compliant with Agent9 async, registry, error handling, and centralized logging standards.
- Legacy patterns and non-compliant integration logic have been removed.
- All integration with this agent is now orchestrator-driven and dynamic; static workflow tests have been removed.
- Test coverage is maintained via orchestrator-based persona and workflow scenarios.
- A9Agent inheritance implemented for standardized agent behavior.
- Pydantic model validation enforced for all inputs and outputs.

## Purpose
Conducts opportunity analysis to identify, score, and recommend actionable business opportunities based on market, product, partnership, innovation, and optimization metrics. The agent evaluates different types of opportunities and provides structured recommendations with quantified potential and risk assessments.

## Key Capabilities
- Opportunity scoring and ranking
- Multi-factor analysis (market, product, partnership, innovation, optimization)
- Recommendation generation
- Integration with orchestrator workflows
- Structured opportunity type classification
- Quantitative risk and potential assessment
- Metrics generation for opportunity categories
- Protocol-compliant input/output model validation

## Inputs
- Opportunity analysis input model (Pydantic)
- Contextual data including:
  - Market context (market size, competition, growth rate, entry barriers, trend score)
  - Product context (innovation, differentiation, market fit, implementation, tech readiness)
  - Partnership context (synergy, alignment, value add, risks, compatibility)
  - Innovation context (potential, impact, feasibility, resources, market window)
  - Optimization context (efficiency, cost reduction, quality, time to market, ROI)

## Outputs
- Structured opportunity lists by category:
  - Market opportunities
  - Product opportunities
  - Partnership opportunities
  - Innovation opportunities
  - Optimization opportunities
- Overall opportunity score (0-100)
- Actionable recommendations
- Metrics by opportunity category
- Status indicator

## Integration
- Registered with Agent9 orchestrator and agent registry
- Accepts only Pydantic models for all entrypoints
- Uses shared logging and error handling patterns
- Inherits from A9Agent base class
- Implements protocol-compliant analyze_opportunities method
- Enforces strict input validation with ValidationError handling

## Test Coverage
- Covered by orchestrator-driven integration/persona scenario tests
- No legacy or static workflow tests remain
- Factory pattern implemented for test data generation
- Comprehensive model factories for all input contexts
- Deterministic output generation for test stability
