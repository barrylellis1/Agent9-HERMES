> **2025-05-13 Update:**
> The A9_Solution_Finder_Agent is now fully refactored and compliant with Agent9 protocol and architectural standards. It uses a Pydantic config model, structured logging, orchestrator-driven registry integration (via `create_from_registry`), and protocol entrypoints with Pydantic models. HITL is supported for all actions. Card/config/code are now fully synchronized. Next steps: update/add tests, compliance, and monitoring as needed.


## Overview
**Purpose:** Systematically generate, evaluate, and recommend solutions to specific problems or diagnoses—especially those surfaced by the Deep Analysis Agent. This agent acts as a driver for problem-solving workflows, scenario evaluation, and decision support, with a human-in-the-loop and iterative refinement. Leverages the Unified Registry Access Layer for business processes, KPIs, and data products.

## MVP Functional Requirements

### Scientific Method, Evidence-Based Validation & Disciplined Reasoning (Updated 2025-05-06)
- The agent must follow a disciplined, unbiased process: hypothesis formation, evidence gathering, and validation before escalating to human input.
- All solution recommendations must be supported by internal or external evidence of effectiveness. If such evidence is lacking, the agent must propose a pilot/experiment and a plan for gathering validation data before adoption.
- LLMs are used to search, summarize, and present supporting evidence or to draft pilot protocols and study plans.
- Escalation to human (via NLP agent prompt or UI) only occurs when analytic/scientific methods are exhausted or when human wisdom, sensory ability, or creativity is likely to yield a breakthrough.
- If no proven or pilotable solutions are available, and human-in-the-loop brainstorming fails to produce actionable ideas, the Solution Finder Agent will escalate the problem to the A9_Innovation_Driver_Agent for creative, out-of-the-box ideation using innovation frameworks and LLM-supported approaches.
- All reasoning steps, failed attempts, escalation triggers, and innovation escalations must be logged for transparency and learning.

### Core Capabilities (MVP)
1. **Problem Intake**
   - Accepts a problem statement, diagnosis, or root cause (from Deep Analysis Agent or user)
   - Validates and structures the problem context using Pydantic models
   - Enriches problem context with relevant business processes, KPIs, and data products from the registry
   - Integrates directly with Deep Analysis Agent for seamless problem intake
   - Supports direct use of Deep Analysis Agent output (A9_Deep_Analysis_Output) as structured input, including insights and recommendations
   - Integrates directly with Market Analysis Agent for tailored market research and intelligence as structured input (A9_Market_Analysis_Output), including LLM-powered insights when available.
   - Market research can be requested and injected as structured Pydantic models into the solution finding process to enhance relevance and decision quality.
2. **Solution Generation**
   - Systematically generates multiple solution options/alternatives for the problem
   - Supports both automated and user-guided brainstorming
   - Allows user to supply constraints, preferences, and iterative feedback
   - Uses registry data to ensure solutions are relevant to business context and constraints
3. **Solution Evaluation**
    - Evaluates and ranks solutions based on criteria provided by Deep Analysis Agent or user (criteria are context-dependent)
    - Supports trade-off analysis and scenario comparison
    - Leverages registry data (KPIs, business processes) for evaluation criteria and impact assessment
    - Creates a trade-off matrix with a recommendation for conflicting objectives
    - **Generates a Trade-Off Analysis Deliverable:** For every major decision point (e.g., speed vs. rigor, cost vs. benefit), the agent produces a structured deliverable comparing all viable options. This includes: option descriptions, expected time to result, confidence level, risks, business impact, and required resources/cost. The deliverable is presented to the principal for review and decision, and all decisions/rationales are logged for audit and learning.
4. **Recommendation & Human-in-the-Loop**
   - Recommends the best solution(s) with supporting rationale and confidence score
   - Provides a clear, actionable summary for decision makers
   - Requires human review, feedback, and iterative solution refinement before finalizing recommendations
   - Supports user-guided cycles: each solution round must allow user feedback and resubmission, enabling iterative improvement until the user is satisfied
   - **Escalation to human (via NLP agent prompt or UI) is only triggered after all analytic/scientific methods are exhausted, in accordance with the scientific method requirement above.**
5. **Audit Logging**
   - Logs all problem statements, solution options, evaluation criteria, and recommendations
   - Logs all solution generation and evaluation steps in detail, including intermediate iterations, user feedback, and rationale for each decision
   - Logs all market research requests, responses, and usage in solution generation for auditability and compliance (including LLM-powered insights).
   - Supports exportable audit trails for compliance and review

### Input Requirements (MVP)
- Pydantic input model for problem statement/diagnosis and context
- Optional: user-supplied constraints, preferences, and feedback

### Output Specifications (MVP)
- Pydantic output model with:
  - Ranked solution options
  - Recommendation and rationale
  - Confidence scores
  - Trade-off matrix (if applicable)
  - **Trade-Off Analysis Deliverable:**
    - Structured comparison of options (table/matrix format)
    - Narrative summary of tradeoffs, pros/cons, and recommendations
    - Explicit prompt for human-in-the-loop decision
    - Captures principal's choice and rationale for audit
  - Audit log reference

---

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Event Design

**Pattern:**
- Only **one HITL event is emitted per solution-finding cycle** (not per solution option).
- This event prompts the principal (human) to review all proposed solutions and either approve the agent's recommended solution or select a different option for downstream processing.
- The HITL event and context are included in the output model fields:
  - `human_action_required: bool`
  - `human_action_type: str` (e.g., "approval")
  - `human_action_context: dict` (includes summary of all options, agent recommendation, rationale, and any special instructions for the principal)
  - `human_action_result: Optional[str]` (principal's decision, set by orchestrator/UI)
  - `human_action_timestamp: Optional[str]`

**Workflow:**
1. Agent generates and ranks solution options, recommends one, and emits a single HITL event in the output.
2. Orchestrator/UI presents all options and the agent's recommendation to the principal.
3. Principal reviews, approves, or overrides the recommendation, and selects one solution to proceed.
4. Principal's decision is recorded in `human_action_result` and `human_action_timestamp`.
5. The approved solution is then passed to the next agent in the workflow.

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies workflow and user experience.
- Matches real-world decision-making (one principal approval per decision cycle).
- Ensures auditability: all HITL events, triggers, and outcomes are logged for compliance and review.
- Avoids unnecessary complexity and approval fatigue from per-option HITL events.

**Audit & Compliance:**
- All HITL triggers and actions are logged in the agent's audit log.
- HITL fields are surfaced to orchestrator/UI for workflow and compliance management.
- Ensures the agent meets regulatory and operational requirements for human oversight.

## Technical Requirements
- Modular, maintainable architecture
- Registry integration and async operations
- Secure configuration and error handling
- Seamless integration with Deep Analysis Agent (accepts A9_Deep_Analysis_Output as input)
- Seamless integration with Market Analysis Agent (accepts A9_Market_Analysis_Output as input, including LLM-powered market research)
- Human-in-the-loop and iterative refinement are required; agent must support user feedback and resubmission cycles
- All solution generation and evaluation steps must be logged for auditability and compliance
- All market research usage (including LLM-sourced insights) must include source attribution and be logged for compliance.

### Integration-First Testing & Interface Refactor (2025-05-11)
- As agent interdependencies increase, brittle unit tests are deprioritized in favor of integration and compliance testing.
- All agents are being refactored for clear boundaries and minimal, well-documented interfaces.
- Testing now prioritizes real agent-to-agent workflows, protocol adherence, and end-to-end compliance.
- Excessive mocking is minimized—only true external dependencies (e.g., APIs, databases) are mocked.
- All agent entrypoints and outputs must be designed for seamless integration, not just isolated logic.
- Regression and compliance suites are used to ensure standards across the ecosystem.
- This approach is now the standard for all Solution Finder Agent compliance and regression testing, and will be applied to all future agent migrations.

---

## Protocol Compliance
- All agent entrypoints must strictly comply with the A2A protocol, accepting and returning Pydantic models for type safety, validation, and interoperability.
- The agent must implement all MCP (Minimum Compliance Protocol) requirements, including compliance checks, reporting, and error handling.
- Protocol compliance is mandatory for registry integration and agent orchestration.

## Problem Mindmap & Agent Network Diagram UI (MVP Requirement, 2025-05-05)
- Implement interactive UI components to visualize problem decomposition as a mindmap and show dynamic agent recruitment/orchestration as a network diagram.
- Rationale: Windsurf Persona Debate consensus (2025-05-05) found these features critical for demo, onboarding, explainability, and market differentiation, provided implementation is low-risk and does not delay core agent delivery.
- Action Items:
  - Use existing visualization libraries (e.g., react-flow, Cytoscape.js) for rapid prototyping.
  - Integrate with orchestrator logs/registry for real-time and historical visualization.
  - Ship a minimal, non-blocking version for MVP (static or read-only acceptable if needed).

> **Tracking:** See BACKLOG_REFOCUS.md for backlog status and actionable items.

## Future Scope (Not in MVP)
- Automated scenario simulation and optimization
- Integration with external solution libraries or expert systems
- Real-time collaborative problem-solving
- User-customizable evaluation criteria and workflows
- Agent learning from solution outcomes and user feedback

## Change Log
- **2025-05-12:** Implemented full HITL escalation logic in Solution Finder Agent; output model and logging now strictly protocol-compliant. Documentation and checklist updated; unit tests cover HITL scenarios and protocol compliance.
- **2025-04-20:** Updated PRD to reflect MVP debate outcomes and Product Owner answers (integration with Deep Analysis, mixed solution generation, human-in-the-loop, trade-off matrix, auditability, strict A2A/MCP compliance).
