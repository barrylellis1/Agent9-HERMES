> **2025-05-13 Update:**
> The A9_Performance_Optimization_Agent is now fully refactored and compliant with Agent9 protocol and architectural standards. It uses a Pydantic config model, structured logging (`A9_SharedLogger`), orchestrator-driven registry integration, and protocol entrypoints with Pydantic models. HITL is documented as not required for this agent. Card/config/code are now fully synchronized. Next steps: update/add tests, compliance, and monitoring as needed.
>
> **2025-05-15 Update:**
> The agent now includes LLM integration for advanced analysis, protocol-compliant input/output models, detailed calculation methods for various business metrics, and integration with Risk Analysis, Change Management, and LLM Service agents.

## Protocol Compliance
- All agent entrypoints must strictly comply with the A2A protocol, accepting and returning Pydantic models for type safety, validation, and interoperability.
- The agent must implement all MCP (Minimum Compliance Protocol) requirements, including compliance checks, reporting, and error handling.
- Protocol compliance is mandatory for registry integration and agent orchestration.
- The agent uses dedicated Pydantic models from `performance_optimization_models.py`:
  - `A9_Performance_Optimization_Input`: Structured input model with financial, operational, customer, employee, and market metrics
  - `A9_Performance_Optimization_Output`: Structured output model with benchmarks, trends, opportunities, recommendations, and explanations

## Change Log
- **2025-04-20:** Refocused agent as business optimizer (not solution-finder/driver); added Protocol Compliance section.
