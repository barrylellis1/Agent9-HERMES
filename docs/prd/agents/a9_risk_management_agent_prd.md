> **2025-05-13 Update:**
> The A9_Risk_Management_Agent is now fully refactored and compliant with Agent9 protocol and architectural standards. It uses a Pydantic config model, structured logging, orchestrator-driven registry integration (via `create_from_registry`), and protocol entrypoints with Pydantic models. HITL is enforced for all actions. Card/config/code are now fully synchronized. Next steps: update/add tests, compliance, and monitoring as needed.

## Compliance & Integration Update (2025-05-01)

- This agent is now fully compliant with Agent9 async, registry, error handling, and centralized logging standards.
- Legacy patterns and non-compliant integration logic have been removed.
- **All integration and testing for this agent is orchestrator-driven and production-like:**
  - Agent inputs and outputs are always real Pydantic model instances, never mocked or stubbed.
  - Integration tests simulate true production workflows, with the orchestrator coordinating all agent calls and data flows.
  - Static workflow tests and direct agent invocation in tests have been deprecated.
- Test coverage is maintained via orchestrator-based persona and workflow scenarios, ensuring compliance with real-world business logic and end-to-end flows.

### Input Requirements
1. Risk Management Data
   - Risk analysis results
   - Mitigation plans
   - Monitoring data
   - Communication records
   - Integration data

2. Management Parameters
   - Management thresholds
   - Mitigation requirements

   - Communication preferences
   - Integration requirements

### Output Specifications
1. Management Artifacts
   - Risk management plans
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Monitoring dashboards
   - Communication materials
   - Integration reports

#### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Output Fields
The output model includes HITL fields for compliance, audit, and operational flexibility:
- `human_action_required` (bool): Signals if human intervention is needed
- `human_action_type` (Optional[str]): Type of intervention (e.g., approval, review)
- `human_action_context` (Optional[dict]): Context for UI/user
- `human_action_result` (Optional[str]): Human's decision/result
- `human_action_timestamp` (Optional[str]): When action was taken

HITL is always triggered for every risk management action. Every call to the agent requires explicit human approval before proceeding. The output always includes `human_action_required = True`, `human_action_type = "approval"`, and a context reason: "All risk management actions require explicit human approval (HITL)". This ensures that every risk management operation is subject to human oversight, regardless of configuration or risk score.

## Protocol Compliance
- All agent entrypoints must strictly comply with the A2A protocol, accepting and returning Pydantic models for type safety, validation, and interoperability.
- The agent must implement all MCP (Minimum Compliance Protocol) requirements, including compliance checks, reporting, and error handling.
- Protocol compliance is mandatory for registry integration and agent orchestration.

---

## A2A Protocol Enforcement
- **All agent entrypoints (e.g., `manage_risk`) must only accept and return Pydantic models, never raw dicts or lists.**
- This ensures type safety, validation, and contract-driven communication between agents and orchestrator.
- Legacy calls and tests using dicts/lists must be refactored to use models as part of the A2A upgrade plan.
- The orchestrator is responsible for enforcing A2A protocol and routing validated model-based requests between agents.
- This is a documented migration and enforcement step for all future agent and orchestrator development.

- See agent and orchestrator design docs for how risk types are surfaced for persona-specific reporting and workflows.

## Testing
- All integration and scenario tests for A9_Risk_Management_Agent are orchestrator-driven and use real agent inputs/outputs, never mocks or stubs.
- After agent migration is complete, all integration tests will be refactored to:
  - Use the orchestrator as the only entrypoint
  - Validate end-to-end workflows for C-level personas and business scenarios
  - Assert on real outputs, with no direct agent calls in test bodies
- This ensures tests reflect production-like behavior and validate the full agent ecosystem.

## Notes
- Focuses on comprehensive risk management
- Works with risk analysis for data
- Generates strategic management recommendations
- Maintains management baselines
- Supports continuous risk improvement
