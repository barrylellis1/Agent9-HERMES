## LLM Integration Prioritization (2025-05-07)

A9_Market_Research_Agent is a high-priority candidate for LLM integration, benefiting from LLM-powered market trend synthesis and competitive intelligence. See the "Agents Prioritized for LLM Integration" table in BACKLOG_REFOCUS.md for rationale and comparison.

---
**Purpose:** Continuously monitor, analyze, and report on market trends, competitor actions, and external signals to inform Agent9 strategy, product development, and risk/opportunity identification.
**Agent Type:** Intelligence/Analysis Agent
**Version:** 1.0
**Template:** Follows A9_Agent_Template patterns

---

## Core Capabilities (MVP)
1. **Market Signal Intake & Structuring**
   - Accepts market data/signals (feeds, reports, user input, and LLM-powered research)
   - Supports direct integration with LLM APIs (e.g., Perplexity, OpenAI, Hugging Face, Together, etc.) for rapid market intelligence gathering.
   - Structures data using Pydantic models (source, type, timestamp, content, etc.)
   - LLM-sourced insights must be parsed into structured Pydantic models and clearly marked as LLM-derived in outputs.
2. **Trend & Competitor Analysis**
   - Identifies and tracks market trends, competitor moves, and external factors
   - Supports automated and user-guided analysis workflows
   - Leverages LLMs for summarization, trend detection, and competitor research when appropriate.
3. **Alerting & Opportunity/Risk Surfacing**
   - Flags significant changes, risks, or opportunities based on analysis
   - Notifies relevant agents or stakeholders
4. **Reporting & Visualization**
   - Generates market analysis reports and dashboards
   - Supports export/sharing of insights
5. **Integration & Coordination**
   - Shares findings with Solution Finder, Risk Management, and Change Management agents
   - Supports cross-agent workflows (e.g., trigger solution ideation or risk analysis)
6. **Audit Logging & Compliance**
   - Logs all market signals, analyses, and reports
   - Ensures compliance with documentation and reporting standards
   - All LLM queries and responses must be logged for auditability and compliance.
   - LLM-derived insights must include source attribution and, where possible, references/citations from the LLM output.

---

## Input Requirements
- Pydantic input model for market signals/data and context
- Optional: user-supplied analysis parameters or filters

---

## Output Specifications
- Pydantic output model with:
  - Market trend/competitor analysis
  - Alerts and surfaced risks/opportunities
  - Reports and dashboards
  - Audit log reference

---

## Technical Requirements
- Modular, maintainable architecture
- Registry integration and async operations
- Secure configuration and error handling
- Full compliance with A2A and MCP protocols (see Protocol Compliance)
- **MCP Integration Pattern:** All join, filter, and aggregation operations are performed by the MCP (Managed Compute Platform) as a service. Agent9 requests summarized, filtered, and pre-joined data products from MCP endpoints. Agent9 acts only as an orchestrator, passing business requests and registry metadata, and receives business-ready results. This ensures performance, governance, and maintainability at scale.
- **HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) Enablement:** Supported via the config-driven `hitl_enabled` flag. When enabled, allows optional human intervention (e.g., prompt review/approval) in DEV/QA and, if desired, in production per customer workflow or trust requirements. Default is fully automated.
- **Integration-First Testing:** All integration and unit tests must use Pydantic model instances for agent input and output, ensuring strict A2A protocol compliance and production-like validation. Orchestrator-driven integration tests are required, using only real agent input/output models (no raw dicts/mocks).
- **Orchestrator-Controlled Registration:** Agent instantiation is strictly orchestrator-controlled with registry injection required. Direct instantiation is forbidden.
- **Pydantic Model Validation:** Uses A9MarketAnalysisAgentConfig for strict config validation and enforces Pydantic models for all inputs and outputs.
- **Fallback Logging System:** Implements a fallback logging mechanism with A9_SharedLogger integration and NullLogger fallback for testing.
- **LLM Integration Implementation:** Direct integration with OpenAI API (compatible with openai>=1.0.0) for market research using GPT-4.1.
- **Signal Aggregation and Analysis:** Processes market signals by type, calculates metrics, and generates trends based on signal values and sources.
- **Threshold-Based Alerting:** Creates alerts for high-value signals with severity levels and escalation flags.
- **Insight Extraction from LLM Responses:** Parses LLM responses to extract structured insights, recommendations, and trends.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Implements try-except blocks with AgentExecutionError for runtime errors and AgentInitializationError for configuration issues.

---

## Protocol Compliance
- All agent entrypoints must strictly comply with the A2A protocol, accepting and returning Pydantic models for type safety, validation, and interoperability.
- The agent must implement all MCP (Minimum Compliance Protocol) requirements, including compliance checks, reporting, and error handling.
- Protocol compliance is mandatory for registry integration and agent orchestration.
- **HITL Compliance:** HITL logic must be gated by the `hitl_enabled` config flag. No blocking or human intervention occurs unless explicitly enabled. All HITL actions must be logged for auditability.
- **Test Protocol:** All tests must use Pydantic models and orchestrator-driven flows; legacy mock-based or dict-based tests are not permitted.

---

## Success Metrics
- Timeliness and relevance of market insights
- Actionability of surfaced risks/opportunities
- Stakeholder satisfaction
- Integration effectiveness with other agents

---

## Future Scope (Not in MVP)
- Automated sentiment analysis and NLP on market signals
- Predictive analytics for market shifts
- Deeper integration with additional external data providers/APIs (beyond LLMs)
- Real-time alerting and collaborative analysis

---

## Change Log
- **2025-05-12:** Documented config-driven HITL enablement (`hitl_enabled` flag), integration-first/orchestrator-driven testing, and strict A2A protocol compliance for all tests and entrypoints. Clarified that HITL is optional and fully documented for DEV/QA/Prod use.
- **2025-04-30:** Updated PRD to explicitly support LLM-powered research (Perplexity, OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.) as a first-class data source for market signal intake, trend/competitor analysis, and reporting. Added requirements for audit logging, source attribution, and structured Pydantic model output for LLM-derived insights.
- **2025-04-20:** Created initial PRD for Market Analysis Agent MVP.
