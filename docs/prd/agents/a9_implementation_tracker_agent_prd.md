# A9_Implementation_Tracker_Agent PRD

<!-- 
CANONICAL PRD DOCUMENT
This is the official, canonical PRD document for this agent.
Last updated: 2025-07-17

> **2025-05-13 Update:**
> The A9_Implementation_Tracker_Agent is now fully refactored and compliant with Agent9 protocol and architectural standards. It uses a Pydantic config model, structured logging, orchestrator-driven registry integration (via `create_from_registry`), and protocol entrypoints with Pydantic models. HITL field is present for protocol compliance (not required for this agent). Card/config/code are now fully synchronized. Next steps: update/add tests, compliance, and monitoring as needed.
>
> **2025-07-16 Update:**
> The Implementation Tracker Agent now features asynchronous processing of action items, parallel status and alert processing, ISO-standardized timestamps, comprehensive error handling with context preservation, and structured recommendations and critical alerts generation. All features are fully implemented and tested.


## Overview

> **COMPLIANCE NOTE:**
> - This agent must ONLY be invoked via the AgentRegistry and orchestrator pattern.
> - Do NOT instantiate directly; always use the async factory method `create_from_registry`.
> - **Usage Example:**
> ```python
> tracker = await AgentRegistry.get_agent("A9_Implementation_Tracker_Agent")
> result = await tracker.track_implementation(...)
> ```

**Purpose:** The Implementation Tracker Agent manages the execution, tracking, and delivery of action items, tasks, and milestones for any change initiative. It does **not** govern overall change readiness, adoption, or value realizationâ€”that is the responsibility of the Change Management Agent. This agent receives implementation plans and milestones from the Change Management Agent and provides real-time progress, accountability, and escalation.
**Agent Type:** Core Implementation Agent
**Version:** 1.0
**Template:** Inherits from A9_Agent_Template (refactored 2025-05-12)

**Config Validation:** Uses Pydantic config model (`A9ImplementationTrackerAgentConfig`) with `hitl_enabled` field for protocol compliance (not implemented, present for A2A/A9 protocol consistency).

**Logging:** All agent logging and error handling use `A9_SharedLogger` for structured, orchestrator-propagated logs.

**Registration:** Agent must be created via the async `create_from_registry` method and registered only by the orchestrator/AgentRegistry. No self-registration or bootstrapping is allowed.

**HITL:** HITL escalation is protocol-compliant (field present, logs when enabled) but escalation logic is not implemented unless required.



## Hackathon Quick Start

### Development Environment Setup
- Clone the Agent9-Hackathon-Template repository
- Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
- Configure environment variables in .env file based on .env.template

### Key Files and Entry Points
- Main agent implementation: `src/agents/new/A9_Implementation_Tracker_Agent_Agent.py`
- Configuration model: `src/agents/new/agent_config_models.py`
- Agent card: `src/agents/new/cards/a9_implementation_tracker_agent_agent_card.py`

### Test Data Location
- Sample data available in `test-data/` directory
- Test harnesses in `test-harnesses/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrates with Agent Registry for orchestration
- Follows A2A protocol for agent communication
- Uses shared logging utility for consistent error reporting

## Implementation Guidance

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Start with the agent's core functionality
2. Implement required protocol methods
3. Add registry integration
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Add validation and testing

### Core Functionality to Focus On
- Protocol compliance (A2A)
- Registry integration
- Error handling and logging
- Proper model validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock registry
- End-to-end tests with test harnesses

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Direct agent instantiation (use registry pattern)
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete logging
- Improper model validation

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Implementation
- Agent implements all required protocol methods
- Agent properly integrates with registry
- Agent handles errors and logs appropriately
- Agent validates inputs and outputs

### Stretch Goals
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features from Future Enhancements section

### Evaluation Metrics
- Protocol compliance
- Registry integration
- Error handling
- Logging quality
- Input/output validation

## Distinction from Change Management Agent
- **Implementation Tracker Agent:** Focuses on operational execution, tracking individual tasks, milestones, blockers, and delivery.
- **Change Management Agent:** Governs overall change process, readiness, adoption, and value realization.

| Agent                       | Scope                | Key Outputs                           | Focus                          | Integration Points                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Change Management Agent     | Org-wide change      | Change plans, readiness, audit logs    | Governance, adoption, value    | Stakeholder, Risk, Implementation |
| Implementation Tracker Agent| Implementation tasks | Task dashboards, status, escalations  | Execution, delivery, blockers  | Change Management, Project Teams  |

## Core Capabilities (MVP)
1. **Action Item Intake & Structuring**
   - Accepts action items/tasks from Change Management Agent (implementation plans/milestones), Solution Finder, Stakeholder Engagement, or user
   - Structures action items using Pydantic models (title, description, owner, due date, dependencies, status, etc.)
   - Implements defensive data handling with fallback mechanisms for incomplete data
2. **Assignment & Ownership Tracking**
   - Assigns owners and tracks responsibility for each action item
   - Supports re-assignment and delegation workflows
   - Provides structured tracking with standardized timestamps
3. **Progress Monitoring & Status Updates**
   - Tracks progress, status changes, and completion of action items
   - Supports milestone tracking and deadline reminders
   - Calculates progress percentages automatically based on status
   - Processes statuses asynchronously for performance optimization
4. **Dependency & Risk Management**
   - Identifies and tracks dependencies between tasks
   - Flags risks and blockers for escalation
   - Generates critical alerts for blocked and overdue items
   - Processes alerts asynchronously in parallel with status updates
5. **Reporting & Transparency**
   - Generates progress, status, and accountability reports
   - Provides dashboards for leadership, stakeholders, and owners
   - Produces structured recommendations with priority levels and justifications
   - Includes detailed metrics (completed, open, blocked counts)
6. **Audit Logging & Compliance**
   - Logs all action item changes, assignments, and status updates
   - Ensures compliance with documentation and reporting standards
   - Implements ISO-standardized timestamps for all tracking events
   - Provides comprehensive error handling with context preservation

---

## Protocol Compliance
- All agent entrypoints must strictly comply with the A2A protocol, accepting and returning Pydantic models for type safety, validation, and interoperability.
- The agent must implement all MCP (Minimum Compliance Protocol) requirements, including compliance checks, reporting, and error handling.
- Protocol compliance is mandatory for registry integration and agent orchestration.
