## Overview
**Purpose:** Coordinate innovation workflow and agent collaboration through workflow orchestration, agent coordination, and decision making. Integrate with the Unified Registry Access Layer to access business processes, KPIs, data products, and principal profiles for context-aware orchestration.

> **COMPLIANCE NOTE:**
> - This agent must ONLY be invoked via the AgentRegistry and orchestrator pattern.
> - Do NOT instantiate directly; always use the async factory method `create_from_registry`.
> - **Usage Example:**
> ```python
> orchestrator = await AgentRegistry.get_agent("A9_Orchestrator_Agent")
> result = await orchestrator.run_workflow(...)
> ```

**Agent Type:** Core Agent
**Version:** 1.0

## Orchestration Architecture

The Orchestrator Agent is the central coordinator for the Agent9 system, designed to drive autonomous workflows without human intervention. While tools like Decision Studio provide UI for demonstration and testing, the core architecture is built around orchestrator-driven agent registration and communication.

### Architectural Principles

1. **Orchestrator-Driven Registration**
   - All agents register with the Orchestrator Agent
   - The Orchestrator maintains a registry of available agents
   - Agents discover each other through the Orchestrator

2. **Protocol-Based Communication**
   - Agents communicate through well-defined protocol interfaces
   - The Orchestrator routes messages between agents based on protocols
   - Protocol interfaces ensure consistent method signatures and return values

3. **Lifecycle Management**
   - The Orchestrator manages agent lifecycle (creation, connection, disconnection)
   - Agents implement standard lifecycle methods (create, connect, disconnect)
   - Proper initialization sequence ensures dependencies are satisfied

### Correct Agent Initialization Sequence

For proper agent initialization, the following sequence should be followed:

1. Initialize Registry Factory and providers
2. Create and connect the Orchestrator Agent
3. Create and register the Data Governance Agent
4. Create and register the Principal Context Agent
5. Create and register the Data Product Agent
6. Create and register the Situation Awareness Agent
7. Connect agents in the same order as registration

This sequence ensures that dependencies between agents are properly satisfied, particularly for the Data Product Agent which depends on the Data Governance Agent for view name resolution.

## Best Practices for LLM-Agent Integration

### Overview
Agent9 agents must interact with LLMs exclusively via the centralized A9_LLM_Service, with all requests and responses routed through the Orchestrator Agent. This ensures protocol compliance, auditability, security, and extensibility for all LLM-powered features.

### Key Principles
- **Centralized LLM Service:** All LLM operations (generation, summarization, analysis, validation, etc.) are performed via A9_LLM_Service. Agents never call LLM APIs directly.
- **Pydantic Validation:** Strict input/output validation using Pydantic models for all LLM requests and responses.
- **Orchestrator Routing:** All LLM calls are routed through the Orchestrator Agent for logging, access control, and compliance.
- **Provider Abstraction:** The LLM service abstracts away provider/model details and supports task-based model selection.
- **Operation-Based API:** LLM requests specify an operation (e.g., "summarize", "analyze", "ideate"), enabling multi-purpose LLM usage.
- **Source Attribution:** All LLM-derived outputs are explicitly marked with `source: "llm"` and include operation/type metadata for traceability and downstream clarity.
- **Extensible Output Block:** LLM outputs are structured in a flexible, typed block (e.g., insights, summaries, recommendations, citations) to support current and future use cases.
- **Prompt Flexibility:** Agents may supply prompt fragments or context, but final prompt assembly and validation are handled centrally in the LLM service.
- **Auditability:** All LLM interactions are logged and auditable via the Orchestrator.
- **Environment Awareness:** Stubs/mocks are used in dev/test environments, with real APIs in prod.

## Implementation Details

### Protocol-Compliant Entrypoints

#### 1. `orchestrate_workflow`
- **Purpose**: Primary method for workflow execution with comprehensive error handling
- **Input**: `OrchestratorWorkflowInput` model
  ```python
  class OrchestratorWorkflowInput(BaseModel):
      workflow_name: str
      steps: List[WorkflowStep]
      context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
  ```
- **Output**: `OrchestratorWorkflowOutput` model with status and results
- **Status Codes**:
  - `success`: All steps completed successfully
  - `partial_success`: Some steps completed successfully, but others failed
  - `error`: The workflow failed to execute

#### 2. `register_agent`
- **Purpose**: Register a new agent in the registry
- **Input**: 
  - `agent_class`: The agent class to register
  - `agent_id`: Unique identifier for the agent
  - `config`: Optional configuration dictionary
- **Output**: Dictionary with registration status and metadata

#### 3. `run_workflow` (Legacy)
- **Deprecated**: Maintained for backward compatibility
- **Recommendation**: Use `orchestrate_workflow` for new code

### Error Handling

#### Workflow Execution Errors
- Each step's error is captured in the `AgentErrorOutput` model:
  ```python
  class AgentErrorOutput(BaseModel):
      error: str
      agent_name: str
      step_index: int
      details: str = ""
  ```
- Workflow continues on step failure when `continue_on_error` is True
- Comprehensive error messages with stack traces in debug mode

#### Input Validation
- All input models validated using Pydantic
- Workflow steps validated before execution
- Type checking for agent method parameters

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables
- `A9_ORCHESTRATOR_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: INFO)
- `A9_ORCHESTRATOR_ENABLE_AUDIT`: Enable audit logging (default: true)
- `A9_ORCHESTRATOR_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR`: Continue workflow execution on error (default: false)

#### Agent Configuration
- Loaded from agent card YAML frontmatter
- Validated against agent's Pydantic model
- Cached for performance

### Audit Logging
- All workflow executions logged with timing information
- Agent registration and instantiation events
- Detailed error logging with context
- Structured log format for easy querying

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow Execution
```python
workflow = OrchestratorWorkflowInput(
    workflow_name="data_processing",
    steps=[
        WorkflowStep(
            agent_name="data_loader",
            method="load_data",
            input=DataLoaderInput(source="api", endpoint="/data")
        ),
        WorkflowStep(
            agent_name="data_processor",
            method="process_data",
            input=DataProcessorInput(transformations=["clean", "transform"])
        )
    ]
)
result = await orchestrator.orchestrate_workflow(workflow)
```

### Error Handling
```python
try:
    result = await orchestrator.orchestrate_workflow(workflow)
    if result.status == "error":
        print(f"Workflow failed: {result.output}")
    elif result.status == "partial_success":
        print("Workflow completed with some errors")
        for agent, output in result.output.items():
            if isinstance(output, AgentErrorOutput):
                print(f"Error in {agent}: {output.error}")
    else:
        print("Workflow completed successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Fatal error: {str(e)}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Pydantic Models**
   - Define input/output models for all agent methods
   - Use field validators for complex validation
   - Document all model fields with docstrings

2. **Error Handling**
   - Handle expected errors gracefully
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Include context for debugging

3. **Workflow Design**
   - Keep steps focused and single-purpose
   - Minimize dependencies between steps
   - Use context to pass data between steps

4. **Testing**
   - Test all error conditions
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Verify audit logs

### Industry Alignment
This approach aligns with enterprise best practices for security, compliance, observability, and future-proofing. It supports both current and anticipated agent-LLM interaction patterns, including multi-turn, streaming, and ensemble querying.

### Recommendations
- Document all supported LLM output types and operations in the LLM service PRD and models.
- Maintain strict adherence to protocol and validation standards for all LLM agent interactions.
- Plan for future extensibility (e.g., streaming, multi-turn sessions, new output types).

## Hybrid Orchestration Strategy

### Purpose
Enable Agent9 agents to operate seamlessly both:
- **Within the Agent9 orchestrator** (for A2A protocol enforcement, fine-grained audit, and portability)
- **Inside enterprise agentic environments** (SAP, Google, Salesforce, etc.), leveraging their native orchestration for infra-level workflow, scaling, and monitoring

### Key Principles

1. **A2A/MCP Enforcement:**  
   Agent9’s orchestrator is the source of truth for Pydantic model validation, agent-to-agent handoff, and compliance/audit logging, regardless of host environment.

2. **Interoperability:**  
   The orchestrator exposes APIs and interfaces that allow it to be:
   - Called as a microservice or workflow step from SAP/Google orchestrators
   - Embedded as a library within larger enterprise workflows
   - Operate standalone for local/demo or hybrid cloud deployments

3. **Delegation:**  
   - **Enterprise orchestrators** handle scheduling, scaling, retries, and external integration.
   - **Agent9 orchestrator** manages agent registry, dynamic team formation, protocol enforcement, and workflow-specific logging/metrics.

4. **Portability:**  
   - Agent9 agents and orchestrator can be deployed on-prem, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments without code changes.
   - All A2A/MCP features work identically across environments.

### Functional Requirements (Hybrid-Specific)

- Expose REST/gRPC endpoints for workflow invocation from enterprise orchestrators
- Support callback/webhook integration for state updates and event notifications
- Allow configuration to delegate workflow steps to SAP/Google-native orchestrators where appropriate
- Maintain audit and compliance logs within Agent9, even when running inside enterprise orchestrators

### Example Integration Patterns

| Pattern                | Enterprise Orchestrator | Agent9 Orchestrator | Use Case                                |
|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Standalone             | No                     | Yes                 | Local demo, MVP, full Agent9 control    |
| Embedded Microservice  | Yes                    | Yes                 | SAP/Google calls Agent9 for core logic  |
| Hybrid Delegation      | Yes                    | Yes                 | SAP/Google manages flow, Agent9 manages agent handoff, compliance, logging |

### MVP Scope

- Demonstrate orchestration both standalone and as a callable service from an enterprise workflow (mocked if needed)
- Show audit trail and compliance logs regardless of invocation source
- Document configuration for both deployment models

### Success Criteria

- All agent handoffs are A2A-compliant (Pydantic models) in every environment
- Audit logs and compliance reports are generated for every workflow, regardless of host
- Orchestrator APIs are callable from at least one external orchestrator (demo/mocked is acceptable for MVP)
