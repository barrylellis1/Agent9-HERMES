# A9_Risk_Analysis_Agent PRD

<!-- 
CANONICAL PRD DOCUMENT
This is the official, canonical PRD document for this agent.

> **2025-07-16 Update:**
> The A9_Risk_Analysis_Agent is now fully refactored and compliant with Agent9 protocol and architectural standards. It uses a Pydantic config model, structured logging (`A9_SharedLogger`), orchestrator-driven registry integration (via `create_from_registry`), and protocol entrypoints with Pydantic models. HITL is documented as not required for this agent. Card/config/code are now fully synchronized. Next steps: update/add tests, compliance, and monitoring as needed.
> 
> **KNOWN ISSUE:** There is a bug in the `__init__` method where `validated_config` is referenced but not defined. This needs to be fixed by properly validating the config using `A9RiskAnalysisAgentConfig(**(config or {}))`.


## Overview
**Purpose:** Provide a minimal, reliable risk assessment for core business risks using simple, explainable logic.
**Agent Type:** Core Agent (MVP)
**Version:** 1.0
**Location:** src/agents/new/

## MVP Functional Requirements

### Core Capabilities (MVP)
1. Risk Type Analysis
   - Analyze **market**, **operational**, and **financial** risks only (expandable later).

2. Risk Assessment
   - Quantify risk likelihood and impact for each core risk type.
   - Generate a single risk score per type.
   - Provide a concise text summary and basic recommendation.

3. Risk Scoring
   - Use simple weighted sum or threshold-based logic.
   - No advanced analytics, heatmaps, or composite scoring in MVP.

4. Basic Reporting
   - Output results as a JSON or CSV artifact.
   - No dashboards, visualizations, or external reporting system integration in MVP.

### Input Requirements (MVP)
- Pydantic input model with fields for context, market, operational, and financial data only.
- Minimal set of analysis parameters (e.g., thresholds, weights).

### Output Specifications (MVP)
- Pydantic output model with:
  - Risk scores (one per type)
  - Status (success/error)
  - Text summary and recommendation
  - Timestamp

## Future Scope (Not in MVP)
- Support for additional risk types (regulatory, reputational, cybersecurity, supply chain, compliance).
- Advanced analytics (correlations, trends, impact analysis).
- Integration with external data sources, regulatory feeds, or threat intelligence.
- Dashboards, visualizations, and export to Tableau/PowerBI (via MCP).
- Multi-agent orchestration and hierarchical risk modeling.
- Automated reporting, documentation, and alerting.



## Hackathon Quick Start

### Development Environment Setup
- Clone the Agent9-Hackathon-Template repository
- Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
- Configure environment variables in .env file based on .env.template

### Key Files and Entry Points
- Main agent implementation: `src/agents/new/A9_Risk_Analysis_Agent_Agent.py`
- Configuration model: `src/agents/new/agent_config_models.py`
- Agent card: `src/agents/new/cards/a9_risk_analysis_agent_agent_card.py`

### Test Data Location
- Sample data available in `test-data/` directory
- Test harnesses in `test-harnesses/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrates with Agent Registry for orchestration
- Follows A2A protocol for agent communication
- Uses shared logging utility for consistent error reporting

## Implementation Guidance

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Start with the agent's core functionality
2. Implement required protocol methods
3. Add registry integration
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Add validation and testing

### Core Functionality to Focus On
- Protocol compliance (A2A)
- Registry integration
- Error handling and logging
- Proper model validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock registry
- End-to-end tests with test harnesses

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Direct agent instantiation (use registry pattern)
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete logging
- Improper model validation

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Implementation
- Agent implements all required protocol methods
- Agent properly integrates with registry
- Agent handles errors and logs appropriately
- Agent validates inputs and outputs

### Stretch Goals
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features from Future Enhancements section

### Evaluation Metrics
- Protocol compliance
- Registry integration
- Error handling
- Logging quality
- Input/output validation

---
**Principles:**
- Keep the MVP simple, testable, and easy to extend.
- All agent entrypoints must accept Pydantic models (no raw dicts/lists).
- Defer all complex integrations and analytics to future phases.

### Input Requirements
1. Risk Data
   - Market data
   - Operational data
   - Financial data
   - Regulatory data
   - Reputational data

2. Analysis Parameters
   - Risk thresholds
   - Analysis criteria
   - Scoring parameters
   - Reporting requirements
   - Integration settings

### Output Specifications
1. Analysis Artifacts
   - Risk assessments
   - Risk scores
   - Risk profiles
   - Risk recommendations
   - Risk documentation

2. Analytics
   - Risk dashboards
   - Risk metrics
   - Risk correlations
   - Risk trends
   - Risk impact analysis

3. Reports
   - Risk analysis reports
   - Risk scoring reports
   - Risk assessment reports
   - Risk integration reports
   - Risk documentation

## Technical Requirements

### Technical HITL enablement:
- The `hitl_enabled` field is present in the agent config for protocol consistency. For the Risk Analysis Agent, HITL is not required or implemented at this time. See config model for rationale.

### Architecture
- Simple class implementation
- Direct functionality
- No separate interfaces
- Uses AgentRegistry for registration
- Follows error handling system
- Logging:
- All logging is performed via `A9_SharedLogger`, ensuring structured, JSON-serialized logs that propagate to the Orchestrator Agent for compliance and auditability.
- Configuration:
- The agent validates its config using the `A9RiskAnalysisAgentConfig` Pydantic model, including the `hitl_enabled` field.
- All entrypoints use Pydantic models for input/output.
- No self-registration; registration is orchestrator-driven via AgentRegistry. The agent never registers itself or performs bootstrapping logic.

### Integration Points
1. Data Systems
   - Connect to data sources
   - Interface with analytics systems
   - Integrate with monitoring systems
   - Connect to reporting systems
   - Interface with compliance systems

2. Output Systems
   - Generate reports
   - Create dashboards
   - Export metrics
   - Generate documentation

### Performance Requirements
1. Analysis Time
   - Basic analysis: < 1 hour
   - Comprehensive analysis: < 4 hours
   - Real-time monitoring: < 15 minutes

2. Processing

   - Maintain data accuracy
   - Support concurrent analyses

### Scalability
1. Support for multiple risk types
2. Handle large data volumes
