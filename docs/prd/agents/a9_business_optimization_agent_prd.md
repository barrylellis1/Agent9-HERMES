- All core and edge-case unit tests pass (no warnings, no deprecated usage).
- Orchestrator integration and agent card config are fully functional.
- Ready for MVP delivery and further integration.

   - Identify underperforming areas
   - Generate performance reports
   - Suggest corrective actions

3. Strategic Recommendations
   - Provide actionable insights for business growth

   - Recommend resource allocation strategies

### Integration Requirements (MVP Alignment)
- Support registry-based integration (A9_Agent_Template pattern)
- All optimization and analysis functions must be async
- Use absolute imports
- Standardize error handling (ConfigurationError, ProcessingError, ValidationError)
- Log optimization attempts, successes, and failures

### Test Requirements (MVP Alignment)
- Test process optimization recommendations (including edge cases)
- Test performance monitoring and reporting
- Test error handling for invalid input
- Test async operation and registry integration
- Document test coverage and assumptions

### Example Request/Response
```python
# Example: Optimize a business process
optimization_agent = ... # Registry lookup
recommendations = await optimization_agent.optimize_process({"workflow": "Order Fulfillment"})
# recommendations -> ["Reduce manual checks", "Automate inventory updates"]
```

### Input Requirements
1. Business Data
   - Workflow definitions
   - Performance metrics
   - Resource allocation data
   - Historical process data

2. Analysis Parameters
   - Optimization goals

   - Performance reports
   - Strategic recommendations

2. Analytics
   - Optimization dashboards
   - Performance metrics
   - Scenario analysis results

## Technical Requirements

### Agent Implementation
- Follow A9_Agent_Template patterns
- Implement create_from_registry for registry-based instantiation
- All agent entrypoints must strictly comply with the A2A protocol, accepting and returning Pydantic models for type safety, validation, and interoperability
- Use standard error handling patterns
- Support async operations
- **Pydantic Model Validation:** Uses A9BusinessOptimizationAgentConfig for strict config validation with exception handling for ValidationError
- **Defensive Configuration:** Ensures all required configuration fields exist with fallback values for missing fields
- **Structured Logging:** Uses A9_SharedLogger for consistent, structured logging with context
- **Numeric Value Parsing:** Uses centralized parse_numeric_value utility for consistent handling of numeric values with proper error handling
- **Market Report Integration:** Incorporates market insights from market_report if provided
- **Type Safety Enforcement:** Validates input types at runtime to ensure A2A protocol compliance
- **Comprehensive Error Logging:** Logs all errors with context for debugging and audit purposes
- **Metadata-Driven Validation:** Uses signal metadata to determine validation requirements (e.g., numeric values)

## Compliance & Integration Update (2025-05-12)
- HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) enablement is fully implemented and enforced for all key actions:
  - The agent config supports a `hitl_enabled` flag.
  - Output protocol fields (`human_action_required`, `human_action_type`, `human_action_context`) are present and validated.
  - When HITL is enabled, all outputs require human approval and set these fields accordingly, with status 'pending_human_approval'.
- All integration and testing for this agent is orchestrator-driven and production-like:
  - Agent inputs and outputs are always real Pydantic model instances, never mocked or stubbed.
  - Integration tests simulate true production workflows, with the orchestrator coordinating all agent calls and data flows.
  - Static workflow tests and direct agent invocation in tests have been deprecated.
- Logging uses `A9_SharedLogger` and is propagated to the Orchestrator Agent.
- Error handling is standardized and protocol-compliant.
- Strict A2A protocol compliance (Pydantic models for all entrypoints/outputs) is maintained.
- Feedback, escalation, and resistance management are available for any optimization scenario.

## Notes
- Focuses on comprehensive business optimization
- Works with business systems for optimization
- Generates strategic recommendations
- Maintains optimization baselines
- Supports continuous business improvement
