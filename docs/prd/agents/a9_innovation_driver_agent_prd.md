## Overview



## Hackathon Quick Start

### Development Environment Setup
- Clone the Agent9-Hackathon-Template repository
- Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
- Configure environment variables in .env file based on .env.template

### Key Files and Entry Points
- Main agent implementation: `src/agents/new/A9_Innovation_Driver_Agent_Agent.py`
- Configuration model: `src/agents/new/agent_config_models.py`
- Agent card: `src/agents/new/cards/a9_innovation_driver_agent_agent_card.py`

### Test Data Location
- Sample data available in `test-data/` directory
- Test harnesses in `test-harnesses/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrates with Agent Registry for orchestration
- Follows A2A protocol for agent communication
- Uses shared logging utility for consistent error reporting

## Implementation Guidance

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Start with the agent's core functionality
2. Implement required protocol methods
3. Add registry integration
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Add validation and testing

### Core Functionality to Focus On
- Protocol compliance (A2A)
- Registry integration
- Error handling and logging
- Proper model validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock registry
- End-to-end tests with test harnesses

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Direct agent instantiation (use registry pattern)
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete logging
- Improper model validation

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Implementation
- Agent implements all required protocol methods
- Agent properly integrates with registry
- Agent handles errors and logs appropriately
- Agent validates inputs and outputs

### Stretch Goals
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features from Future Enhancements section

### Evaluation Metrics
- Protocol compliance
- Registry integration
- Error handling
- Logging quality
- Input/output validation

## LLM Integration Prioritization (2025-05-07)

A9_Innovation_Agent is the highest-priority candidate for LLM integration, benefiting from LLM-powered idea generation, creative synthesis, and debate simulation. See the "Agents Prioritized for LLM Integration" table in BACKLOG_REFOCUS.md for rationale and comparison.

---
**Purpose:** Identify, prioritize, and drive innovation opportunities across Agent9 initiatives by surfacing new ideas, evaluating feasibility and impact, and coordinating innovation projects from ideation to implementation.
**Agent Type:** Innovation/Orchestration Agent
**Version:** 1.0
**Template:** Follows A9_Agent_Template patterns

---

## Core Capabilities (MVP)
1. **Opportunity Intake & Ideation**
   - Accepts innovation ideas/opportunities (from Market Analysis, Solution Finder, user, or external sources)
   - Structures ideas using Pydantic models (source, description, value, feasibility, etc.)
2. **Feasibility & Impact Evaluation**
   - Evaluates potential value, feasibility, and alignment with strategy
   - Supports automated and user-guided evaluation workflows
3. **Prioritization & Selection**
   - Prioritizes innovation opportunities based on defined criteria (impact, feasibility, urgency, strategic fit)
   - Maintains an innovation backlog
4. **Project Coordination & Tracking**
   - Coordinates innovation projects from selection to implementation
   - Tracks milestones, status, and outcomes
   - Integrates with Implementation Tracker Agent
5. **Feedback & Continuous Improvement**
   - Gathers feedback from stakeholders and project outcomes
   - Iteratively refines innovation processes and criteria
6. **Audit Logging & Compliance**
   - Logs all innovation ideas, evaluations, decisions, and outcomes
   - Ensures compliance with documentation and reporting standards

---

## Input Requirements
- Pydantic input model for innovation ideas/opportunities and context
- Optional: user-supplied evaluation criteria, priorities, or constraints

---

## Output Specifications
- Pydantic output model with:
  - Evaluated and prioritized innovation opportunities
  - Project coordination and tracking data
  - Feedback and improvement metrics
  - Audit log reference

---

## Technical Requirements
- Modular, maintainable architecture
- Registry integration and async operations
- Secure configuration and error handling
- Full compliance with A2A and MCP protocols (see Protocol Compliance)
- Agent card loading and validation using AgentCard Pydantic schema
- Structured audit logging for all innovation analyses
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback logging
- Threshold-based alerting for innovation signals
- Signal-based innovation analysis with metrics, opportunities, alerts, and recommendations
- Timestamp-based audit logging for all operations

---

## Protocol Compliance & Implementation Status (2025-06-08)
- All agent entrypoints strictly comply with the A2A protocol, accepting and returning Pydantic models for type safety, validation, and interoperability.
- Implements all MCP (Minimum Compliance Protocol) requirements, including compliance checks, reporting, error handling, and audit logging.
- **Agent instantiation is orchestrator-controlled only:**
    - Direct instantiation is forbidden; the async factory `create_from_registry(registry, config)` must be used for all agent creation.
    - The agent enforces registry injection and will raise on fallback instantiation attempts.
    - Example usage and test patterns are documented in the agent card and test suite.
- **Agent card loading and validation:**
    - Implements `get_agent_card()` class method for loading and validating the agent card using AgentCard Pydantic schema
    - Handles YAML frontmatter parsing with proper error handling
    - Returns validated card dictionary for orchestrator-driven registration
- **Configuration validation and management:**
    - Uses A9InnovationDriverAgentConfig Pydantic model for strict config validation
    - Implements `_validate_config()` method to ensure required fields are present
    - Validates capabilities as a list and config as a dictionary
- **Comprehensive error handling:**
    - Implements try-except blocks with detailed error messages
    - Uses A9_SharedLogger for structured error logging
    - Provides fallback logging for agent initialization errors
    - Raises AgentExecutionError with context for runtime errors
- **Signal-based innovation analysis:**
    - Processes innovation signals with type, value, and source attributes
    - Calculates metrics by signal type
    - Generates opportunities based on signal values and types
    - Creates alerts for high-value signals with severity levels
    - Provides recommendations based on aggregated metrics
- Audit logging is implemented for all innovation analyses; logs are structured and handled via `A9_SharedLogger`.
- Test suite uses async factory, registry injection, and test data factories for protocol-compliant, maintainable tests.
- See `src/agents/new/cards/A9_Innovation_Driver_Agent_card.md` for up-to-date example usage and compliance status.
- All protocol, config, and test patterns match Agent9 standards as of 2025-06-08.
