# UI Design Agent PRD

## Overview

The UI Design Agent provides user interface design and UX capabilities for Agent9. It enables the design, analysis, and optimization of UI components and layouts to ensure consistent, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces across Agent9 applications.

## Features

### Core Functionality

1. **Component Design**
   - Design UI components based on configuration parameters
   - Generate component properties, styles, and accessibility attributes
   - Support various component types and variants

2. **Design Analysis**
   - Analyze UI designs for usability, accessibility, and consistency
   - Calculate design metrics (complexity, consistency, accessibility, usability)
   - Identify design issues and provide recommendations

3. **Layout Optimization**
   - Optimize UI layouts for different screen sizes and devices
   - Provide grid, responsive, and component layout optimization
   - Support customizable layout configurations

### Integration Points

1. **Registry Integration**
   - Orchestrator-controlled instantiation via AgentRegistry
   - Support for agent_id tracking and registry-based lookup

2. **Context Propagation**
   - Maintain design context throughout the design process
   - Support for configuration-based design customization

## Technical Requirements

### Data Models

1. **Input Models**
   - Component configuration dictionaries
   - Layout configuration dictionaries
   - Design analysis input dictionaries

2. **Output Models**
   - Component design dictionaries
   - Layout optimization dictionaries
   - Design analysis result dictionaries

### Configuration

1. **Agent Configuration**
   - Support for debug and logging configuration
   - Component and layout default configurations

### Error Handling

1. **Logging**
   - Comprehensive error logging via A9_SharedLogger
   - Context-aware error reporting

## User Experience

### Inputs

1. **Component Configuration**
   - Component type, name, and variant
   - Style and property preferences
   - Accessibility requirements

2. **Layout Configuration**
   - Grid configuration (columns, gutters, breakpoints)
   - Responsive design preferences
   - Component spacing and alignment

### Outputs

1. **Component Design**
   - Component properties (variant, size, disabled state)
   - Component styles (color, font size, padding, margin)
   - Accessibility attributes (aria labels, roles)

2. **Layout Optimization**
   - Optimized grid settings
   - Responsive design configurations
   - Component layout recommendations

3. **Design Analysis**
   - Design metrics (complexity, consistency, accessibility, usability)
   - Identified design issues with severity and description
   - Design recommendations with priority and effort estimates

## Implementation Details

### Agent Creation

The agent follows the orchestrator-controlled instantiation pattern:

```python
ui_design_agent = await AgentRegistry.get_agent("A9_UI_Design_Agent")
component = ui_design_agent.design_component(component_config)
```

### Component Design Process

1. Component configuration is provided
2. Agent generates component properties based on configuration
3. Agent generates component styles based on configuration
4. Agent generates accessibility attributes based on configuration
5. Complete component design is returned

### Design Analysis Process

1. Design is provided for analysis
2. Agent calculates design metrics (complexity, consistency, accessibility, usability)
3. Agent identifies design issues with severity and component information
4. Agent generates design recommendations with priority and effort estimates
5. Complete analysis results are returned

### Layout Optimization Process

1. Layout configuration is provided
2. Agent optimizes grid layout (columns, gutters, breakpoints)
3. Agent optimizes responsive design (breakpoints, media queries, flex direction)
4. Agent optimizes component layout (spacing, alignment, nesting)
5. Complete optimized layout is returned



## Hackathon Quick Start

### Development Environment Setup
- Clone the Agent9-Hackathon-Template repository
- Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
- Configure environment variables in .env file based on .env.template

### Key Files and Entry Points
- Main agent implementation: `src/agents/new/A9_UI_Design_Agent_Agent.py`
- Configuration model: `src/agents/new/agent_config_models.py`
- Agent card: `src/agents/new/cards/a9_ui_design_agent_agent_card.py`

### Test Data Location
- Sample data available in `test-data/` directory
- Test harnesses in `test-harnesses/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrates with Agent Registry for orchestration
- Follows A2A protocol for agent communication
- Uses shared logging utility for consistent error reporting

## Implementation Guidance

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Start with the agent's core functionality
2. Implement required protocol methods
3. Add registry integration
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Add validation and testing

### Core Functionality to Focus On
- Protocol compliance (A2A)
- Registry integration
- Error handling and logging
- Proper model validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock registry
- End-to-end tests with test harnesses

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Direct agent instantiation (use registry pattern)
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete logging
- Improper model validation

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Implementation
- Agent implements all required protocol methods
- Agent properly integrates with registry
- Agent handles errors and logs appropriately
- Agent validates inputs and outputs

### Stretch Goals
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features from Future Enhancements section

### Evaluation Metrics
- Protocol compliance
- Registry integration
- Error handling
- Logging quality
- Input/output validation

## Future Enhancements
