   - Generate comprehensive engagement assessment

2. **Recommendation Generation**
   - Provide actionable recommendations for improving stakeholder engagement
   - Prioritize recommendations based on engagement scores
   - Generate owner-specific and domain-specific recommendations

3. **Event-Driven Integration**
   - Process StakeholderAnalysisCompletedEvent from Stakeholder Analysis Agent
   - Convert stakeholder maps into engagement-focused data models
   - Trigger engagement analysis based on completed stakeholder analysis

4. **Audit and Tracking**
   - Maintain audit log of engagement actions
   - Track engagement metrics over time
   - Provide engagement history for compliance and reporting

### Integration Points

1. **Event-Based Workflow**
   - Receive events from Stakeholder Analysis Agent
   - Support event-based integration with downstream agents

2. **Registry Integration**
   - Orchestrator-controlled instantiation via AgentRegistry
   - Support for agent_id tracking and registry-based lookup

3. **Context Propagation**
   - Maintain context throughout engagement process
   - Support for change context from upstream agents

## Technical Requirements

### Data Models

1. **Input Models**
   - A9_Stakeholder_Engagement_Input: Contains stakeholder information and engagement data

2. **Output Models**
   - A9_Stakeholder_Engagement_Output: Contains engagement metrics, recommendations, and audit information
   - EngagementMetrics: Model for tracking engagement metrics

3. **Event Models**
   - StakeholderAnalysisCompletedEvent: Event received from Stakeholder Analysis Agent

### Configuration

1. **Agent Configuration**
   - Validated via A9StakeholderEngagementAgentConfig Pydantic model
   - Support for debug and logging configuration

### Error Handling

1. **Logging**
   - Comprehensive error logging via A9_SharedLogger
   - Context-aware error reporting

2. **Validation**
   - Input validation using Pydantic models
   - Configuration validation at instantiation

## User Experience

### Inputs

1. **Stakeholder Data**
   - Support for structured stakeholder data input
   - Support for engagement metrics input
   - Support for events from Stakeholder Analysis Agent

### Outputs

1. **Engagement Analysis**
   - Engagement metrics across multiple dimensions
   - Overall engagement assessment
   - Stakeholder-specific engagement insights

2. **Recommendations**
   - Prioritized engagement recommendations
   - Owner-specific and domain-specific recommendations
   - Critical alerts for stakeholders with low engagement scores

## Implementation Details

### Agent Creation

The agent follows the orchestrator-controlled instantiation pattern:

```python
engagement_agent = await AgentRegistry.get_agent("A9_Stakeholder_Engagement_Agent")
result = engagement_agent.analyze_stakeholder_engagement(input_data)
```

### Analysis Process

1. Stakeholder data is provided via A9_Stakeholder_Engagement_Input or received from Stakeholder Analysis Agent
2. Agent maps stakeholders by domain and owner for reporting
3. Engagement scores are calculated across multiple dimensions
4. Recommendations are generated based on engagement scores and stakeholder mapping
5. Results are returned as A9_Stakeholder_Engagement_Output

### Recommendation Generation

1. Generate workflow recommendations for owners
2. Identify consensus gathering needs for domains with multiple owners
3. Flag critical stakeholders with low satisfaction or trust scores
4. Provide metrics summary and critical alerts
5. Include governance integration recommendations



## Hackathon Quick Start

### Development Environment Setup
- Clone the Agent9-Hackathon-Template repository
- Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
- Configure environment variables in .env file based on .env.template

### Key Files and Entry Points
- Main agent implementation: `src/agents/new/A9_Stakeholder_Engagement_Agent_Agent.py`
- Configuration model: `src/agents/new/agent_config_models.py`
- Agent card: `src/agents/new/cards/a9_stakeholder_engagement_agent_agent_card.py`

### Test Data Location
- Sample data available in `test-data/` directory
- Test harnesses in `test-harnesses/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrates with Agent Registry for orchestration
- Follows A2A protocol for agent communication
- Uses shared logging utility for consistent error reporting

## Implementation Guidance

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Start with the agent's core functionality
2. Implement required protocol methods
3. Add registry integration
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Add validation and testing

### Core Functionality to Focus On
- Protocol compliance (A2A)
- Registry integration
- Error handling and logging
- Proper model validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock registry
- End-to-end tests with test harnesses

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Direct agent instantiation (use registry pattern)
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete logging
- Improper model validation

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Implementation
- Agent implements all required protocol methods
- Agent properly integrates with registry
- Agent handles errors and logs appropriately
- Agent validates inputs and outputs

### Stretch Goals
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features from Future Enhancements section

### Evaluation Metrics
- Protocol compliance
- Registry integration
- Error handling
- Logging quality
- Input/output validation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Sentiment analysis for stakeholder feedback
   - Predictive modeling for engagement trends

2. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Direct integration with communication platforms
   - Real-time engagement monitoring

3. **Visualization**
   - Engagement dashboard visualization
   - Trend analysis and reporting

## Compliance and Security

1. **Data Protection**
   - Stakeholder engagement data is handled according to data governance policies
   - Sensitive stakeholder information is properly secured

2. **Auditability**
   - All engagement actions are logged for audit purposes
   - Engagement metrics are tracked over time for compliance reporting

## Dependencies
