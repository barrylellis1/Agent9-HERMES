# A9_Quality_Assurance_Agent PRD

<!-- 
CANONICAL PRD DOCUMENT
This is the official, canonical PRD document for this agent.

> **2025-07-16 Update:**
> The A9_Quality_Assurance_Agent is now fully refactored and compliant with Agent9 protocol and architectural standards. It uses a Pydantic config model, structured logging (`A9_SharedLogger`), orchestrator-driven registry integration, and protocol entrypoints with Pydantic models. HITL is documented as not required for this agent. Card/config/code are now fully synchronized. Next steps: update/add tests, compliance, and monitoring as needed.




## Hackathon Quick Start

### Development Environment Setup
- Clone the Agent9-Hackathon-Template repository
- Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
- Configure environment variables in .env file based on .env.template

### Key Files and Entry Points
- Main agent implementation: `src/agents/new/A9_Quality_Assurance_Agent_Agent.py`
- Configuration model: `src/agents/new/agent_config_models.py`
- Agent card: `src/agents/new/cards/a9_quality_assurance_agent_agent_card.py`

### Test Data Location
- Sample data available in `test-data/` directory
- Test harnesses in `test-harnesses/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrates with Agent Registry for orchestration
- Follows A2A protocol for agent communication
- Uses shared logging utility for consistent error reporting

## Implementation Guidance

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Start with the agent's core functionality
2. Implement required protocol methods
3. Add registry integration
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Add validation and testing

### Core Functionality to Focus On
- Protocol compliance (A2A)
- Registry integration
- Error handling and logging
- Proper model validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock registry
- End-to-end tests with test harnesses

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Direct agent instantiation (use registry pattern)
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete logging
- Improper model validation

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Implementation
- Agent implements all required protocol methods
- Agent properly integrates with registry
- Agent handles errors and logs appropriately
- Agent validates inputs and outputs

### Stretch Goals
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features from Future Enhancements section

### Evaluation Metrics
- Protocol compliance
- Registry integration
- Error handling
- Logging quality
- Input/output validation

## Compliance & Integration Update (2025-05-01)
- This agent is now fully compliant with Agent9 async, registry, error handling, and centralized logging standards.
- Legacy patterns and non-compliant integration logic have been removed.
- All integration with this agent is now orchestrator-driven and dynamic; static workflow tests have been removed.
- Test coverage is maintained via orchestrator-based persona and workflow scenarios.

## Purpose
Ensures solution quality and compliance through comprehensive testing and validation.

## Key Capabilities
- Quality criteria definition
- Test case generation and management
- Test suite creation and execution
- Compliance verification
- Performance and security testing
- Code quality analysis and recommendations
- Integration with orchestrator workflows

## Implementation Details

### Test Case Management
- Generates test cases based on requirements
- Creates and manages test suites
- Estimates code coverage
- Maintains test configurations for unit, integration, performance, and security testing

### Test Execution
- Executes test suites and returns results
- Runs individual tests within suites
- Calculates test metrics (pass rate, coverage, duration)
- Generates test execution reports

### Code Quality Analysis
- Analyzes code quality metrics
- Calculates complexity, coupling, and other code metrics
- Identifies code quality issues
- Generates code quality recommendations

### Registry Integration
- Registers with the Agent9 registry
- Creates agent instances from registry
- Handles registration errors robustly

## Inputs
- Quality assurance input model (Pydantic)
- Solution specifications
- Compliance standards
- Test requirements
- Codebase information
- Test data
- Performance metrics

## Outputs
- Quality test plans
- Test cases and test suites
- Test execution results
- Code quality analysis reports
- Compliance reports
- Performance metrics

- Code quality recommendations

## Integration
- Registered with Agent9 orchestrator and agent registry
- Accepts only Pydantic models for all entrypoints
- Uses shared logging and error handling patterns
- Integrates with A9_SharedLogger for consistent logging

## Test Coverage
- Covered by orchestrator-driven integration/persona scenario tests
- No legacy or static workflow tests remain
