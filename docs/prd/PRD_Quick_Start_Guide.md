# Agent9 PRD Quick Start Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides a quick overview of the Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) in the Agent9 Hackathon Template. PRDs are essential documents that define the functionality, requirements, and specifications for each agent and service in the Agent9 platform.

## PRD Structure

Each PRD follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - A high-level description of the agent or service, including its purpose, type, and version.

2. **Functional Requirements** - Detailed descriptions of the agent's capabilities, input requirements, and output specifications.

3. **Technical Requirements** - Integration points, dependencies, and implementation details.

4. **Compliance Requirements** - Protocol compliance, error handling, and logging requirements.

5. **Testing Requirements** - Testing strategies and validation approaches.

6. **Success Metrics** - Criteria for evaluating the agent's performance.

7. **Hackathon Quick Start** - Hackathon-specific guidance for implementation.

8. **Implementation Guidance** - Suggested approaches, core functionality focus areas, and testing strategies.

## Navigating the PRDs

All PRDs are located in the `docs/prd/` directory:
- Agent PRDs: `docs/prd/agents/`
- Service PRDs: `docs/prd/services/`

For a complete list of all available PRDs, refer to the [PRD Index](index.md).

## Core Agents

The following agents form the core of the Agent9 platform and are essential for implementing the main workflows:

### Workflow Agents

1. **[Orchestrator Agent](agents/a9_orchestrator_agent_prd.md)** - Coordinates innovation workflow and agent collaboration.

2. **[Principal Context Agent](agents/a9_principal_context_agent_prd.md)** - Manages principal context and preferences.

3. **[Situation Awareness Agent](agents/a9_situation_awareness_agent_prd.md)** - Monitors KPIs and identifies situations requiring attention.

4. **[Deep Analysis Agent](agents/a9_deep_analysis_agent_prd.md)** - Performs detailed analysis of identified situations.

5. **[Solution Finder Agent](agents/a9_solution_finder_agent_prd.md)** - Identifies potential solutions to problems.

### Data Agents

6. **[Data Product Agent](agents/a9_data_product_agent_prd.md)** - Manages data products and provides data access capabilities.

7. **[Data Governance Agent](agents/a9_data_governance_agent_prd.md)** - Enforces data governance rules and policies.

### Service Agents

8. **[NLP Interface Agent](agents/a9_nlp_interface_agent_prd.md)** - Provides natural language processing capabilities.

9. **[LLM Service Agent](agents/a9_llm_service_agent_prd.md)** - Manages interactions with LLM providers.

## Core Services

1. **[Data Product MCP Service](services/a9_data_product_mcp_service_prd.md)** - Provides data product capabilities as a microservice.

## Implementation Priority

For the hackathon, focus on implementing the core workflow agents in the following order:

1. Orchestrator Agent
2. Principal Context Agent
3. Situation Awareness Agent
4. Deep Analysis Agent
5. Solution Finder Agent

## Key Implementation Requirements

When implementing agents based on these PRDs, ensure:

1. **Protocol Compliance** - All agents must follow the A2A protocol and use Pydantic models for input/output validation.

2. **Registry Integration** - All agents must integrate with the Agent Registry and use the `create_from_registry` factory method.

3. **Error Handling** - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging using the shared logging utility.

4. **Testing** - Write unit tests for core functionality and integration tests with mock registry.

## Additional Resources

- [Agent9 Agent Design Standards](../Agent9_Agent_Design_Standards.md) - Mandatory standards for agent development.
- [Test Data Usage Guide](../Test_Data_Usage_Guide.md) - Guidelines for using test data.
- [LLM Model Specifications](../LLM_Model_Specifications.md) - Specifications for LLM models.
- [LLM Credit Estimation](../LLM_Credit_Estimation.md) - Guidelines for estimating LLM credit consumption.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Direct Agent Instantiation** - Never instantiate agents directly; always use the registry pattern.
2. **Missing Error Handling** - Ensure comprehensive error handling and logging.
3. **Incomplete Validation** - Always validate inputs and outputs using Pydantic models.
4. **Protocol Violations** - Strictly adhere to the A2A protocol for all agent interactions.
5. **Ignoring Context Propagation** - Ensure proper propagation of context fields between agents.
