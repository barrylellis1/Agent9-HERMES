# A9_Data_Product_Agent MVP – Persona Debate Meeting Minutes

**Date:** 2025-04-20  
**Attendees:** Business Owner, Data Steward, Technical Architect, Analyst/User Advocate, Risk/Compliance, Marketing/Product, Investor, Product Owner (USER)

## Discussion Summary

> **Note:** The Data Product Agent focuses on discovering and cataloging existing data products to service other agents and users, not creating new data products. Data Governance agents already exist and handle compliance, quality, and governance enforcement.

**Business Owner:**  
- Wants the agent to make it easy to discover and leverage existing data products for business value.
- Asks how the agent will ensure product information is current and relevant.

**Data Steward:**  
- Interested in how data product metadata, lineage, and quality will be surfaced and kept up to date.
- Asks about integration with Data Governance agents and catalogs.

**Technical Architect:**  
- Supports modular, protocol-compliant design and integration with catalogs, registries, and governance agents.
- Raises the need for scalable discovery and efficient metadata management.

**Analyst/User Advocate:**  
- Wants clear, searchable cataloging and documentation of available data products.
- Asks how users will be able to find, understand, and request access to data products.

**Risk/Compliance:**  
- Supports MVP if all product actions and changes are logged and auditable.
- Wants to ensure compliance with governance and reporting standards, in coordination with Data Governance agents.

**Marketing/Product:**  
- Sees value in messaging around “data product discoverability and reuse.”
- Wonders how the agent will differentiate from generic data catalogs.

**Investor:**  
- Interested in the agent’s impact on data product adoption, business outcomes, and stakeholder satisfaction.
- Asks about metrics for product usage, quality, and discoverability.

**Product Owner (USER):**  
- (You are invited to provide input or answer specific questions from the group.)

## Key Questions for Product Owner (USER)

**1. What are the most important outcomes you want from data product discovery and cataloging?**
- Discoverability is the top priority.

**2. Should the agent prioritize automated discovery, user curation, or a mix?**
- Automated discovery should be prioritized. User curation should be handled by the Data Governance agent.

**3. How much human review or override do you want in the cataloging process?**
- Review only.

**4. Are there specific data domains or product types to focus on first?**
- ERP-related data domains such as SAP, SuccessFactors, Salesforce, Oracle.

**5. How should the agent handle outdated, incomplete, or low-quality data products?**
- Initiate change management process to archive or deprecate the data product.

**6. Are there key integration points (e.g., Data Governance, catalogs, registries) that must be seamless?**
- MCP integration with Data Catalog products is critical. If a catalog does not exist, we may need to develop a Data Catalog agent.

**7. How should requests for new data products be handled (given that creation is out of scope for MVP)?**
- If a new data product is needed, route to Solution Finder to engage the right stakeholders and get an initiative started to develop that data product.
