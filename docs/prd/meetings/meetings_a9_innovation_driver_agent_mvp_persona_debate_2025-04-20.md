# A9_Innovation_Driver_Agent MVP – Persona Debate Meeting Minutes

**Date:** 2025-04-20  
**Attendees:** Business Owner, Data Steward, Technical Architect, Analyst/User Advocate, Risk/Compliance, Marketing/Product, Investor, Product Owner (USER)

---

## Discussion Summary

> **Note:** In the future, discrete agents may be developed to perform the same process as our persona debate, but in agent form (agent-based debate and evaluation).

**Business Owner:**  
- Wants the agent to surface high-value, feasible innovation opportunities that align with business strategy.
- Asks how the agent will prioritize among competing ideas and ensure follow-through to implementation.

**Data Steward:**  
- Interested in how innovation ideas are structured, validated, and tracked for impact and learnings.
- Asks about compliance with data governance and documentation standards.

**Technical Architect:**  
- Supports modular, protocol-compliant design and integration with other agents (Market Analysis, Solution Finder, Implementation Tracker).
- Raises the need for scalable evaluation and prioritization workflows, possibly agent-based in the future.

**Analyst/User Advocate:**  
- Wants clear, interpretable evaluation and prioritization of innovation ideas.
- Asks how feedback and learnings will be captured and used for continuous improvement.

**Risk/Compliance:**  
- Supports MVP if all innovation actions and decisions are logged and auditable.
- Wants to ensure compliance with documentation and risk management standards.

**Marketing/Product:**  
- Sees value in messaging around “systematic innovation orchestration.”
- Wonders how the agent will differentiate from generic innovation management tools.

**Investor:**  
- Interested in the agent’s impact on value creation, feasibility, and time-to-market.
- Asks about metrics for innovation ROI and stakeholder satisfaction.

**Product Owner (USER):**  
- (You are invited to provide input or answer specific questions from the group.)

## Key Questions for Product Owner (USER)

**1. What are the most important outcomes you want from innovation management?**
- Value creation is the top priority.

**2. Should the agent prioritize automated evaluation, user-guided workflows, or a mix?**
- A mix of automated and user-guided workflows.

**3. How much human review or override do you want in the innovation process?**
- Significant human review is needed.

**4. Are there specific sources or types of innovation opportunities to focus on first?**
- Focus on technical gaps for Agent9 deployments and integration with tools via MCP.

**5. How should the agent handle conflicting or competing innovation ideas?**
- (Not explicitly answered, but implied: use human review and prioritization, possibly agent-based debate in future.)

**6. Are there key integration points (e.g., Market Analysis, Solution Finder, Implementation Tracker) that must be seamless?**
- It may recruit any number of Agent9 agents as needed.

**7. Would agent-based debate/evaluation (multiple agent personas) be valuable in the future?**
- Quite possibly yes.

- Ensure integration with Market Analysis, Solution Finder, and Implementation Tracker agents.
- Support automated and user-guided evaluation and prioritization.
- Provide clear, interpretable reporting and feedback mechanisms.
- Log all innovation actions, decisions, and outcomes for auditability.
- Ensure strict A2A protocol (Pydantic models) and MCP (compliance, reporting, error handling) compliance.
- Develop messaging around “systematic innovation orchestration.”
- Define metrics to track value creation, feasibility, and stakeholder satisfaction.
- Explore agent-based debate/evaluation for future releases.
