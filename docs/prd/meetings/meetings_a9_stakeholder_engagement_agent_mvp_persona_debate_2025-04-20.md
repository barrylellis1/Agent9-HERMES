## Key Questions for Product Owner (USER)

**1. What are the most important outcomes you want from stakeholder engagement?**
- The outcomes depend on the specific solution or opportunity being proposed; no two engagements will be exactly alike.

**2. Should the agent prioritize automated engagement, guided workflows, or a mix?**
- Automated engagement should be prioritized, with a human problem or opportunity owner helping to gather consensus. This may not be 100% agent capability.

**3. How much human review or override do you want in the engagement process?**
- (No explicit answer provided; inferred to require human involvement as above.)

**4. Are there specific stakeholder groups or domains to focus on first?**
- No, keep it general.

**5. How should the agent handle conflicting stakeholder priorities or feedback?**
- The agent should coordinate with the Problem or Opportunity Owner to have one or more decision meetings, providing trade-off analysis or other materials for discussion.
