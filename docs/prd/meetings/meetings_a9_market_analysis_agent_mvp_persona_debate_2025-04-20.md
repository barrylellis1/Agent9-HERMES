## Key Questions for Product Owner (USER)

**1. What are the most important outcomes you want from market analysis?**
- Actionability is the top priority.

**2. Should the agent prioritize automated analysis, user-guided workflows, or a mix?**
- Automated analysis should be prioritized.

**3. How much human review or override do you want in the analysis and alerting process?**
- Enable the function to gather more market research to corroborate findings.

## Natural Language Q&A for Data Products

**Objective:**
Enable users to ask business questions about SAP data products in natural language and receive business-contextualized, registry-compliant answers.

**Features:**
- Rule-based NLP parser for extracting KPIs, filters, and groupings from user queries.
- Mapping of business terms to technical columns using governance registry.
- Protocol-compliant, orchestrator-driven execution via Data Product Agent.
- Optional LLM integration for advanced, conversational queries (future enhancement).
- Audit and governance for all NLP-driven actions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can ask business questions and receive correct, contextual answers from SAP data.
- All queries are routed through registry-driven, protocol-compliant agent logic.
- LLM responses (if enabled) are validated for compliance and correctness.

**4. Are there specific data sources or types of market signals to focus on first?**
- No.

**5. How should the agent handle conflicting or ambiguous market signals?**
- See answer 3: Enable the function to gather more market research to corroborate.

**6. Are there key integration points (e.g., Solution Finder, Risk Management) that must be seamless?**
- Likely Solution Finder, Business Optimization, and Innovation Driver agents will integrate the most.
