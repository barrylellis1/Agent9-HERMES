## Key Questions for Product Owner (USER)

**1. What are the most important outcomes you want from implementation tracking?**
- Completion is the top priority.

**2. Should the agent prioritize automated tracking, guided workflows, or a mix?**
- Automated tracking should be prioritized.

**3. How much human review or override do you want in the tracking process?**
- Perhaps an oversight role for a Project Management Office (PMO).

**4. Are there specific integration points (e.g., Change Management, Risk Management) that must be seamless?**
- Yes, but not sure what they are yet.

**5. How should the agent handle blockers, risks, or dependencies that impact implementation?**
- Similar escalation or alert process as other agents (escalate to responsible parties/owners).

**6. What is the clear line of delineation between this agent and Change Management or Risk Management agents?**
- (To be further discussed; see debate for ongoing clarification.)
