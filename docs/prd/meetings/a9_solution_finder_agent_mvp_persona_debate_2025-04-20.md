## Key Questions for Product Owner (USER)

**1. What are the most important criteria for evaluating solutions?**
- The criteria are dependent on the context and outputs of the Deep Analysis Agent.

**2. Should the agent prioritize automated solution generation, user-guided brainstorming, or a mix of both?**
- It should be a mix of both.

**3. How much human review or override do you want in the solution recommendation process?**
- This will definitely require a human-in-the-loop and iterative solution refinement.

**4. Are there specific types of problems or domains to focus on first?**
- No, keep it general.

**5. How should the agent handle conflicting objectives or trade-offs between stakeholders?**
- Create a trade-off matrix with a recommendation.
