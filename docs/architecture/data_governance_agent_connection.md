# Data Governance Agent Connection Pattern

## Current Implementation

The Data Product Agent attempts to use the Data Governance Agent for view name resolution but lacks the proper initialization and connection code:

```python
# Check if we have a Data Governance Agent to delegate to
if not hasattr(self, 'data_governance_agent') or not self.data_governance_agent:
    self.logger.warning("Data Governance Agent not available for view name resolution")
    return self._get_fallback_view_name(kpi_definition)
```

This results in the warning: `WARNING:src.agents.new.a9_data_product_agent:Data Governance Agent not available for view name resolution`

## Missing Connection Pattern

Unlike the MCP Service Agent which is properly initialized in the `_async_init` method, the Data Governance Agent is never initialized or connected:

```python
# Initialize MCP Service Agent
try:
    self.logger.info("Initializing MCP Service Agent for SQL execution delegation")
    self.mcp_service_agent = await A9_Data_Product_MCP_Service_Agent.create({
        "database": {
            "type": "duckdb",
            "path": self.db_path
        }
    }, logger=self.logger)
    self.logger.info("MCP Service Agent initialized successfully")
except Exception as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Error initializing MCP Service Agent: {str(e)}")
    self.logger.warning("Will use direct database access as fallback")
```

## Recommended Connection Pattern

Following the Agent9 architecture principles, the Data Governance Agent should be connected through the Orchestrator Agent:

```python
# In _async_init or connect method
try:
    # Get Data Governance Agent from Orchestrator
    if self.orchestrator:
        self.data_governance_agent = await self.orchestrator.get_agent("data_governance")
        if self.data_governance_agent:
            self.logger.info("Successfully retrieved Data Governance Agent from Orchestrator")
        else:
            self.logger.warning("Data Governance Agent not available from Orchestrator")
except Exception as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Error retrieving Data Governance Agent: {str(e)}")
```

## Fallback Mechanism

The current fallback mechanism is well-designed and provides graceful degradation when the Data Governance Agent is unavailable:

```python
# Fall back to local resolution if Data Governance Agent fails
return self._get_fallback_view_name(kpi_definition)
```

This ensures that the system can continue to function even when the Data Governance Agent is not available, which is important for resilience.

## Architectural Alignment

To align with the Agent9 architecture:

1. The Orchestrator Agent should be responsible for agent registration and retrieval
2. The Data Product Agent should get the Data Governance Agent from the Orchestrator
3. The connection should happen during the agent's connect lifecycle method
4. Proper error handling and fallbacks should be maintained

This pattern ensures proper separation of concerns and follows the protocol-driven design principles of Agent9.
