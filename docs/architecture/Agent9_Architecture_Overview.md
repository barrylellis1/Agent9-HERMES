# Agent9 Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

Agent9 is built on an agent-based orchestration architecture that enables modular, extensible, and protocol-driven interactions between specialized components. The system is designed to provide automated business insights and solutions through a series of workflows involving multiple agents working together.

### Core Architectural Principles

1. **Protocol-Driven Design**: All agent interactions follow well-defined protocols with standardized input/output models.
2. **Registry-Based Component Management**: Agents, KPIs, data products, and principal profiles are managed through dedicated registries.
3. **Orchestrator-Driven Workflows**: The A9_Orchestrator_Agent coordinates multi-step workflows across agents.
4. **Card-Based Agent Configuration**: Agents are configured and registered using standardized agent cards.
5. **Asynchronous Processing**: Core workflows support asynchronous execution for improved performance.

## Component Architecture

### Agent Registry

The Agent Registry is the central component responsible for:
- Registering and managing agent lifecycles
- Validating agent configurations
- Providing agent lookup and discovery
- Tracking agent events and status

All agents must register with the Agent Registry to be available for orchestration.

### Core Agents

#### A9_Orchestrator_Agent

The orchestrator is responsible for:
- Managing multi-step workflows across agents
- Handling agent registration and configuration
- Validating workflow protocols
- Tracking workflow state and progress
- Error handling and recovery

#### A9_Principal_Context_Agent

Manages principal (user) context including:
- Principal profile management
- Access control and permissions
- Context-aware decision support
- Principal preferences and settings

#### A9_Situation_Awareness_Agent

Identifies business situations requiring attention:
- Monitors KPIs and thresholds
- Detects anomalies and patterns
- Prioritizes situations based on impact
- Generates situation summaries

#### A9_Deep_Analysis_Agent

Performs detailed analysis of identified situations:
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Trend analysis
- Correlation detection
- Contextual enrichment

#### A9_Solution_Finder_Agent

Generates and evaluates potential solutions:
- Solution generation
- Solution evaluation and ranking
- Implementation planning
- Outcome prediction

### Supporting Agents

- Data access control
- Data quality monitoring
- Compliance validation
- Audit trail maintenance

#### A9_Data_Product_Agent

Manages data products:
- Data product registration
- Schema validation
- Data transformation
- Data product discovery

#### A9_NLP_Interface_Agent

Provides natural language processing capabilities:
- Query parsing and understanding
- Intent recognition
- Entity extraction
- Response generation

#### A9_LLM_Service_Agent

Manages LLM interactions:
- Prompt engineering
- Context management
- Response processing
- Model selection and routing

## Registry Architecture

### KPI Registry

Manages Key Performance Indicators:
- KPI definition and metadata
- Threshold configuration
- KPI categorization and tagging
- Business process mapping

### Principal Profiles Registry

Manages principal (user) profiles:
- Role-based access control
- Preference management
- Context tracking
- Notification settings

### Data Product Registry

Manages data products:

- Lineage tracking

## UI Architecture

### Decision Studio

The Decision Studio is the central UI for:
- Workflow orchestration
- Situation monitoring and management
- Analysis visualization
- Solution evaluation and selection
- Configuration management

## Protocol Architecture

### Agent Protocol

All agents implement a standard protocol that includes:
- Registration with the Agent Registry
- Configuration validation
- Standard entrypoints (check_access, process_request)
- Event logging
- Error handling

### Workflow Protocol

Workflows follow a standard protocol:
- Defined input/output models
- Step sequencing
- Error handling
- State management
- Result aggregation

## Data Architecture

### Data Models

- All data models use Pydantic for validation
- Models follow a consistent naming convention
- Models include schema validation
- Models support serialization/deserialization

### Data Contracts

- Data contracts define expected inputs/outputs
- Contracts are validated at runtime
- Contracts support versioning
- Contracts include documentation

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization
