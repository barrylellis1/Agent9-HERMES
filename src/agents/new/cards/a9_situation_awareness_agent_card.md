# A9_Situation_Awareness_Agent Card

## Agent Description
The Situation Awareness Agent provides automated KPI monitoring and situation detection based on principal context and business processes. It analyzes Finance KPIs from the FI Star Schema to detect anomalies, trends, and insights, presenting them as actionable situations with severity levels, business impact analysis, and suggested next steps.

## Primary Purpose
To provide personalized situation awareness for Finance KPIs, enabling principals to quickly understand the current state of their business metrics, identify anomalies, and take appropriate action.

## Core Capabilities
- Finance KPI monitoring and anomaly detection
- Principal-specific situation awareness based on role and context
- Business process-aligned KPI prioritization
- Natural language query processing for KPI insights
- Human-in-the-loop feedback handling
- Recommended diagnostic questions

## Configuration Model
```python
class SituationAwarenessAgentConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for the Situation Awareness Agent."""
    
    # Required configuration
    contract_path: str = Field(
        description="Path to the data contract YAML file"
    )
    
    # Optional configuration
    kpi_thresholds: Optional[Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]] = Field(
        None,
        description="Custom KPI thresholds, overriding contract defaults"
    )
    principal_profile_path: Optional[str] = Field(
        None,
        description="Optional path to custom principal profile definitions"
    )
```

## Usage Examples

### Detecting Situations for a CFO
```python
from src.agents.new.a9_situation_awareness_agent import create_situation_awareness_agent
from src.agents.models.situation_awareness_models import (
    SituationDetectionRequest, PrincipalContext, PrincipalRole, 
    BusinessProcess, TimeFrame, ComparisonType
)

# Create the agent
agent = create_situation_awareness_agent({
    "contract_path": "path/to/fi_star_schema.yaml"
})
await agent.connect()

# Define principal context for CFO
cfo_context = PrincipalContext(
    role=PrincipalRole.CFO,
    business_processes=[
        BusinessProcess.PROFITABILITY_ANALYSIS,
        BusinessProcess.REVENUE_GROWTH
    ],
    default_filters={},
    decision_style="strategic",
    communication_style="executive_summary",
    preferred_timeframes=[TimeFrame.CURRENT_QUARTER]
)

# Create request
request = SituationDetectionRequest(
    request_id="req-123",
    principal_context=cfo_context,
    business_processes=[BusinessProcess.PROFITABILITY_ANALYSIS],
    timeframe=TimeFrame.CURRENT_QUARTER,
    comparison_type=ComparisonType.QUARTER_OVER_QUARTER
)

# Detect situations
response = await agent.detect_situations(request)

# Process results
for situation in response.situations:
    print(f"{situation.severity}: {situation.description}")
    print(f"Business Impact: {situation.business_impact}")
    if situation.suggested_actions:
        print("Suggested Actions:")
        for action in situation.suggested_actions:
            print(f"- {action}")
    print()
```

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with A9_NLP_Interface_Agent for advanced query parsing
- Enhanced business impact analysis using LLM
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Multi-dimensional trend analysis
- Enhanced visualization capabilities in Decision Studio UI
