# A9_Solution_Finder_Agent Card

Status: MVP Scaffolding

## Overview
The `A9_Solution_Finder_Agent` systematically generates, evaluates, and recommends solutions for diagnosed problems (often from Deep Analysis). It produces a trade-off matrix and emits a single HITL approval event per cycle (per PRD). Optionally, it can leverage the LLM Service to run an expert persona debate and synthesize a consensus rationale.

## Protocol Entrypoints
- `recommend_actions(request: SolutionFinderRequest) -> SolutionFinderResponse`
- `evaluate_options(request: SolutionFinderRequest) -> SolutionFinderResponse`

Models defined in `src/agents/models/solution_finder_models.py`.

## Configuration Schema
Defined in `src/agents/agent_config_models.py`:

```python
class A9_Solution_Finder_Agent_Config(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(extra="allow")
    # Core behavior
    hitl_enabled: bool = True  # Single HITL event per cycle
    enable_llm_debate: bool = False  # Toggle persona debate and consensus
    expert_personas: List[str] = [
        "QA Lead", "Operations Manager", "Finance Controller"
    ]
    # Scoring weights
    weight_impact: float = 0.5
    weight_cost: float = 0.25
    weight_risk: float = 0.25
    # Orchestration & logging
    require_orchestrator: bool = True
    log_all_requests: bool = True
```

## Dependencies
- `A9_Deep_Analysis_Agent` (consumes its output for context)
- `A9_LLM_Service_Agent` (optional narrative/evidence synthesis via orchestrator)

## Compliance
- A2A Pydantic IO for requests/responses
- Orchestrator-driven lifecycle; single HITL event per cycle
- Full audit logging of options, scoring, recommendation, and human approvals

## Deliverables (MVP)
- Ranked options
- Trade-off matrix (impact/cost/risk)
- Recommendation + rationale
- HITL approval context and audit trail
