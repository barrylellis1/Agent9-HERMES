## 1. Agent Overview & Metadata
- **A9-prefixed Name:** A9_Orchestrator_Agent
- **Team / Agent Context Tags:** core, orchestrator
- **Purpose:** Central brain that enforces the A2A protocol, manages agent registry & lifecycle, coordinates multi-agent workflows, handles logging/audit, and propagates YAML contract context.
- **Owner:** <owner_or_squad>
- **Version:** 1.0

## 2. Configuration Schema
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict

class A9OrchestratorConfig(BaseModel):
    registry_path: str = "src/agents/new/agent_registry.yaml"
    logging_level: str = "INFO"
    enable_audit: bool = True
    continue_on_error: bool = False
    max_concurrent_workflows: int = 10
    model_config = ConfigDict(extra="allow")
```
- **Required secrets / external resources:** None

## 3. Protocol Entrypoints & Capabilities
| Entrypoint | Description | Input Model | Output Model | Side-effects |
|------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| `orchestrate_workflow` | Execute multi-step workflow | `OrchestratorWorkflowInput` | `OrchestratorWorkflowOutput` | logs + audit |
| `register_agent` | Register agent class & config | `AgentRegistrationRequest` | `Dict` | updates registry |
| `run_workflow` (deprecated) | Legacy wrapper | `OrchestratorWorkflowInput` | `Dict` | logs events |

# Protocol Compliance and Dynamic Agent Loading
- Agent card config loading is strictly orchestrator-private. No agent, sub-agent, or test code may load or use card config directly.
- The orchestrator uses private methods (_load_agent_card_config, _resolve_agent_class) to:
  - Load agent configuration from the agent card for each agent required by the workflow.
  - Map agent names to their Python classes for registration.
- Only agents listed in the workflow steps are registered and instantiated for each workflow execution.
- No agent is registered or instantiated unless required by the current workflow.
- All agent config must be sourced and validated by the orchestrator using the Agent Card as the single source of truth.
- See orchestrator code for private method details and usage pattern.
- WARNING: Any attempt to load agent card config outside the orchestrator is a protocol violation and will be flagged in code review and CI.

# YAML Contract Metadata Propagation
- The orchestrator detects and propagates `yaml_contract_text` from the `extras` field of any agent step result.
- This YAML contract text is injected into the shared context and passed to all downstream steps via the `context` kwarg.
- Downstream agents always receive the latest YAML contract context in their `context` argument.
- Unit tests verify propagation through multi-step workflows for strict protocol compliance.

# Workflow Status Codes
# - success: All steps completed successfully
# - partial_success: Some steps completed successfully, but others failed
# - error: The workflow failed to execute
---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow Execution
```python
from src.agents.new.A9_Orchestrator_Agent import OrchestratorWorkflowInput, WorkflowStep

# Create a workflow with multiple steps
workflow = OrchestratorWorkflowInput(
    workflow_name="example_workflow",
    steps=[
        WorkflowStep(
            agent_name="data_loader",
            method="load_data",
            input=DataLoaderInput(source="api", endpoint="/data")
        ),
        WorkflowStep(
            agent_name="data_processor",
            method="process_data",
            input=DataProcessorInput(transformations=["clean", "transform"])
        )
    ]
)

# Execute the workflow
result = await orchestrator.orchestrate_workflow(workflow)
```

### Error Handling
```python
try:
    result = await orchestrator.orchestrate_workflow(workflow)
    if result.status == "error":
        print(f"Workflow failed: {result.output}")
    elif result.status == "partial_success":
        print("Workflow completed with some errors")
        for agent, output in result.output.items():
            if isinstance(output, AgentErrorOutput):
                print(f"Error in {agent}: {output.error}")
    else:
        print("Workflow completed successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Fatal error: {str(e)}")
```

## Concurrency Support
The orchestrator supports concurrent workflow execution with the following features:

- Configurable maximum number of concurrent workflows
- Thread-safe execution of workflow steps
- Isolated context for each workflow execution
- Proper error isolation between concurrent workflows

### Example: Running Concurrent Workflows
```python
import asyncio

async def run_concurrent_workflows(orchestrator, workflows):
    """Run multiple workflows concurrently."""
    tasks = [orchestrator.orchestrate_workflow(workflow) for workflow in workflows]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

# Create multiple workflows
workflow1 = OrchestratorWorkflowInput(
    workflow_name="workflow1",
    steps=[...]
)
workflow2 = OrchestratorWorkflowInput(
    workflow_name="workflow2",
    steps=[...]
)

# Run them concurrently
results = await run_concurrent_workflows(orchestrator, [workflow1, workflow2])
```

## Best Practices
1. Always use `orchestrate_workflow` for new code (preferred over `run_workflow`)
2. Implement proper error handling for workflow steps
3. Use Pydantic models for all input/output to ensure type safety
4. Keep workflow steps focused and single-purpose
5. Use the audit log for debugging and compliance
6. When running concurrent workflows, ensure they are independent to avoid race conditions
7. Monitor system resources when increasing `max_concurrent_workflows`
8. Use the `continue_on_error` flag to control whether workflow execution should continue after a step fails
