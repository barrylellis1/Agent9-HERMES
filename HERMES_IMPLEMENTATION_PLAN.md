## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Claude 3 Sonnet Integration Strategy

HERMES will leverage Claude 3 Sonnet using the following approach:

1. **Structured Prompt Templates**
   - Utilize the templates from `cascade_prompt_templates.md` for consistent agent development
   - Implement PRD-first approach with mandatory analysis before implementation
   - Use standardized input/output formats for predictable agent behavior

2. **Guardrails Implementation**
   - Apply the patterns from `cascade_guardrails.md` for code quality and standards compliance
   - Enforce strict protocol adherence through validation checks
   - Implement trust-but-verify principle with source code verification

3. **Optimized Context Management**
   - Implement efficient context compression and handoff techniques
   - Use structured data formats to maximize relevant information retention
   - Apply chain-of-thought reasoning for complex analytical tasks
