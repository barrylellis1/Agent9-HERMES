# Agent9 MVP Implementation Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Agent9 MVP, developed in accordance with the `MVP_GUIDE.md`, `Agent9_Agent_Design_Standards.md`, and all reviewed Product Requirement Documents (PRDs). The objective is to build a production-grade, compliant, and robust system from the ground up.

**Guiding Principles:**
- **Orchestrator-Driven Architecture**: No direct agent instantiation. All interactions are managed by the `A9_Orchestrator_Agent`.
- **Protocol-First**: Strict adherence to the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol using Pydantic V2 models.
- **Compliance by Design**: All components will be built to meet the standards for naming, configuration, testing, and documentation.
- **Incremental, Bottom-Up Build**: Develop foundational components first, followed by individual agents, and finally the orchestrator to ensure a stable and testable process.

## 2. Phased Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundational Components & Core Infrastructure

**Objective**: Establish the core building blocks and patterns for all agents.

1.  **Directory Structure Setup**:
    - Re-create `src/agents/` for all new agent code.
    - Re-create `src/agents/cards/` for agent cards.
    - Create `src/agents/utils/` for shared utilities.
    - Create `src/agents/models/` for core Pydantic models.
    - Re-create `tests/` for all test suites.

2.  **Shared Utilities (`src/agents/utils/`)**:
    - **Logging**: Implement a shared logger (`A9_SharedLogger`).
    - **Error Handling**: Define custom, structured exception classes.

3.  **Core Pydantic Models (`src/agents/models/`)**:
    - Define base request/response models for the A2A protocol.
    - Create common data structures (e.g., `SituationReport`, `AnalysisResult`) that will be used across multiple agents.

4.  **Agent Infrastructure**:
    - **Base Agent Class**: Create an abstract base class (`A9_Agent`) in `src/agents/base_agent.py` to enforce compliance. It will include abstract methods for `register_with_registry`, configuration loading, and protocol entrypoints.
    - **Agent Registry**: Implement the `AgentRegistry` (`src/agents/agent_registry.py`) as a singleton for dynamic, orchestrator-driven agent loading and access.

### Phase 2: Core Agent Implementation

**Objective**: Build each core agent, ensuring it is compliant, unit-testable, and adheres to its PRD.

For each agent, the following artifacts will be created:
- Agent implementation file (`src/agents/a9_*_agent.py`)
- Pydantic configuration model in `src/agents/agent_config_models.py`
- Agent Card (`src/agents/cards/a9_*_agent_card.py`)
- Unit tests (`tests/unit/test_a9_*_agent.py`)

**Implementation Order**:
1.  **`A9_Principal_Context_Agent`**: Foundational agent that provides user context and access control. It is a dependency for most other agents.
2.  **`A9_Situation_Awareness_Agent`**: The entry point for the primary workflow. It will identify situations to be analyzed.
3.  **`A9_Deep_Analysis_Agent`**: Takes a situation and performs a structured Kepner-Tregoe root cause analysis.
4.  **`A9_Solution_Finder_Agent`**: Takes the root cause and generates potential solutions, managing the HITL event.

### Phase 3: Orchestrator and Workflow Integration

**Objective**: Tie all agents together into a functioning, end-to-end workflow.

1.  **`A9_Orchestrator_Agent` Implementation**:
    - Implement the orchestrator to manage the full workflow: `Situation Awareness` -> `Deep Analysis` -> `Solution Finder`.
    - It will use the `AgentRegistry` to dynamically load and invoke agents based on a declarative workflow definition.
    - It will handle state management, error propagation, and logging for the entire process.

2.  **Integration Testing**:
    - Create integration tests (`tests/integration/`) that invoke the `A9_Orchestrator_Agent` to run the full workflow.
    - These tests will validate the A2A protocol between agents and ensure the end-to-end process works as designed.
    - Mocking will be limited to true external dependencies (e.g., databases, external APIs).

## 3. Testing and Compliance

- **Unit Tests**: Each agent will have its own suite of unit tests to verify its internal logic.
- **Integration Tests**: The orchestrator will be tested to ensure seamless agent-to-agent communication and workflow execution.
- **Compliance Checks**: Before finalizing, a full audit will be conducted to ensure all code adheres to the `Agent9_Agent_Design_Standards.md`, including naming, protocol compliance, and the creation of all required artifacts (cards, configs).

## 4. Submission

Upon completion of all phases and successful execution of all tests, the project will be submitted for evaluation as per the `MVP_GUIDE.md`.
